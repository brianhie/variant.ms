Not that in color yt was like thy haire
for armlettes of that thou mightst let me weare
not that thy hand it ofte imbracd and kist
(for so yt hadd that good w%5ch%6 ofte I %Ymisht%Z mist
Nor for that sillie old morallitie
that as these linkes are tied our loue should be
morne I that I thy seven fold chaine haue lost
nor for the lucke sake but for the bitter cost
Oh shall 12 righteous angels w%5ch%6 as yet
noe leaven of vile soader did admit
nor yet by any faulte haue straid or gone
from the first state of their erration
Angels w%5ch%6 heaven comanded to provide
all thinges to mee to be my faithfull guid
to gaine newe freinds to appease >%^%5great%6< enemies
to comfort my soule when I ly or rise
shall these 12 Innocentes by thy severe
sentence, dread, iudge my sinnes great burden beare
shall they be damn'd & in the furnace throwen
and punisht for offences not their owen
They saue not me they >%^%5doe not%6< ease my paines
When in that hell th'are %Ybut%Z burnt & tied in chaines
Were the but crowes->>crow%^%5n%6es< of Fraunce I carred not
for most of these their naturall contry rott
I thinke possesseth here they come to vs
so hale, so lame, so leane, so ruinous
And howsoever french, K. most christians->>christian< be
their crownes are circumsiz'd most Iewishly
or were the spannish stampes still travelinge
That are become as Catholike as their kinge
Those vnlict beare whelpes, vnfild pistolets
That more then common shote availes or lettes
That negligently lefte vnrounded looke [16r
Like many angled figures in the booke
Of some great coniurer that would enforce 
Nature as these doe iustice from her course.
That like the soule runes through the head feete & harte
as streames like vaines run through th earthes everie p%Pte
Visite all countries and haue slelie made
Gorgeous fraunce ragged ruind and decaid
Scotland w%5ch%6 knew noe state proud in one day
and mangled 17 headed belgia.
Or were yt such gold as that wher w%5th%6 all
Almighties Chismickes->>Chimickes< from each minerall
havinge by subtile fier a soule out puld
are durtely and desperately guld
I would not spite to quench the fier ther in
for they are guiltie of much heanous sin
But shall my harmeles Angels p%Pish shall
I loose my guard my liefe, myne ease mine all
much hope that the should norish wilbe dead.
much of mine able youth and liuelie head
will vanish, yf thou loue lett them alone
For thou wilt loue me less when they are gone
Oh be content that some lowd squeking crier
well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane threedbare groate for hier
may like a devill roare throug everie street
and gall the finders conscience yf the meete
Or let me creepe to some dread coniurer
that w%5th%6 fantasticke scheames fulfils much pap%P
and hath devided heaven in tenements.
and w%5th%6 whores theeues and murderers stuft his rents
so full that though he passe them all in sin
he leaue himselfe noe rome to enter in
And yf when all his arte and time is spent [f. 34v
he say twill nere befound, yet be content
Receiue from him the doome vngrudgingly
by cause he is the mouth of destinie
Thou (saiest (alas) the gould doth still remaine
though it be chaunged and put into a chaine
So in the first faln angels resteth still
wisdome and knowledge, but tis turnd to ill.
As these should doe good works and should p%Puide
necessities but now must nurse thy pride
