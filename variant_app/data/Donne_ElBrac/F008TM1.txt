 Not that in cullour it was like thy hayre
 For armletes of thou maist let me weare
 Nor that thy hand it oft embrac'd and kiss'd
 For so it had that good w%5ch%6 oft I missd
 Nor for that silly ould morality;
 That as those linckes are tyed o%5r%6 loves should bee
 Mourne I that I thy seven fold chaine have lost
 Nor for the luckes sake but the bitter Cost.
 Oh shall twelue righteous Angells w%5ch%6 as yet
 No leven of Vile solder did admit
 Nor yet by any fault have straid or gon
 From the first state of their creato%Mn;
 Angells w%5ch%6 heaven Commaunded to provide
 All thinges to me and to be my faithfull guide
 To gaine new frendes, to appease great enimyes
 To Comfort my soule when I lye or rise
 Shall these twelue innocentes by thy severe
 Sentence,, great Iudge, my sins great burden beare?
 Shall they be damn'd and in the furnace throwne
 And punish'd for offences not their owne?
 They save not me they doe but ease my paines
 When in that hell thei'r burnt and tied in chaines
 Were they but Crownes of Fraunce I cared not
 For most of them their naturall Cuntry rot [CW:/I#thincke]
 I thinck possesseth they come heere to vs [p.24]
 So leane, so pale, so lame, so ruynous.
 And howsoere French kings most Ch[h->>r<]istian be
 Their Crownes are Circumcisd most Iewishly
 Or were they Spanish Stamps still travailing
 That are become as Catholicke as their king
 Those unlickd beare whelps vnfild pistoletes
 That more then common shot avayles or lettes.
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded looke
 Like many angled figures in a booke
 Of some great Coniurer w%5ch%6 would enforce
 Nature as those do iustice from hir course,
 W%5ch%6 as the soule quickens head, feet, and hart
 As streames like veynes run through y%5e%6 earths euery p%Pte
 Vizit all Cuntreys and have slily made
 Gorgeous Fraunce ruynd, ragged and decayd,
 Scotland w%5ch%6 knew no state proud in %ya%Z->>%Vone< day
 And mangled seventeene headed Belgia
 Or were it such gould as that wherew%5th%6all
 Allmighty Chymickes from each minerall
 Having by subtill fire a soule out pul'd
 Are dirtely and desperatly gull'd
 I would not spit to quench the fier they were in
 For they are gilty of much haynous sin.
 But shall my harmelesse Angelles p%Pish? shall
 I loose my guard, myne ease, my food, my all? [CW:/Much]
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they did nourish will bee dead [p.25]
 Much of myne able youth and lusty head 
 Will Vanish if thou love not them alone
 For thou wilt love lesse when they are gon
 O be content that some loud speaking Crier,
 Well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane thread bare groat for hire 
 May like a divell rore through every street
 And gall the finders Conscience if they meet.
 Or let me Creep to some dread Coniurer
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastick scheames fullfills much paper
 W%5ch%6 hath divided heaven into tenementes
 And w%5th%6 whores, theeves, and murtherers stufft hir rents
 So full, that though %Ys%Zhee passe them all in sin
 Hee leaves him self no roome to enter in.
 And, if when all his art and tyme is spent
 Hee say twi'll nere be found; o, be content,
 Receave from him the dome vngrudgingly,
 Because hee is the mouth of destiny.
 Thou saist (alas) the gould doth still remayne
 Though it be chang'd and put into a chaine
 So in the first fallen Angells resteth still
 Wisdome and knowledge but t'is turnd to ill
 All these should do good workes and should p%Pvide
 Necessities, but now must nurse thy pride [CW:/And.|]
 And they are still bad Angells myne are none [p.26]
 Forme giues being and their forme is gon.
 Pitty these Angells yet their dignities,
 Passe Virtues, Powers, and Principalities
 But thou art resolut thy will be don
 Yet w%5th%6 such anguish as hir only sonne
 The mother in the hungrie grave doth lay
 Vnto the fire these martyrs I betray.
 Good soules for yo%5u%6 giue life to every thing
 Good Angells for good messages yo%5u%6 bring
 Destind yo%5u%6 migst have beene to such a one
 As would have lovd and worshipd yo%5u%6 alone
 One who would have sufferd hunger nakednesse
 Yea death ere hee would make yo%5r%6 number lesse
 But I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sadd decay
 May yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer w%5th%6 me stay
 But o%C thou wretched finder whom I hate 
 >%VSo#much< That I %YCould%Z almost pitty thy%Yne%Z %Ye%Zstate
 Gould being the heaviest mettall mongst all
 May my most heavy Curse vpon thee fall
 Here fettred, manacled, and hangd in chaines
 First mayst thou be then chaynd in hellish paines
 Or be w%5th%6 forrayne gould bribde to betray
 Thy Cuntrey and faile both of that & thy pay
 May the next thing thou stoopst to reach contayne
 Poyson whose nymble fume rot thy moyst brayne
 Or libells or some interdicted thing
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruyne bring [CW:/Lust-bread|]
 Lust-bread diseases rot thee and dwell w%5th%6 thee [p.27]
 Itchie desier and no abilitie
 May all the hurt w%5ch%6 ever gould hath wrought
 All mischiefes w%5ch%6 all divells ever thought;
 Want after plenty poore and gowty age
 The plagues of travalers, loue, and marriage
 Afflict thee; And at thy liues latest momment
 May thy lives swolen sinnes them selues to thee p%5re%6sent
 But I forgiue repent then honest man
 Gould is restoratiue restore it then
 Or if w%5th%6 it thou best loth to depart
 Because till->>tis< Cordiall would twere at thy hart.|
