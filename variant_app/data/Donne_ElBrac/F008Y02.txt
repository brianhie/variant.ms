 Nott y%5t%6 in coulor itt was like thy haire
 for Armeletts of y%5t%6 thou mayst lett me weare
 nor y%5t%6 thy hand itt ofte inbract & kist
 for so itt had y%5e%6 good w%5ch%6 ofte I miss
 Nor for y%5t%6 silly old Morrallitie
 That as thes linkes are tied, our soules should be
 Mourne I y%5t%6 I thy seauen fould chane->>chaine< haue lost
 Nor for thy %Ys%Zlucks sake, but y%5e%6 bitter coste
 Oh y%5t%6 22 rightuous Angles w%5ch%6 as yett
 noe leauen of vild sober did admitt
 Nor yet by any faulte haue strayd or gon
 from y%5e%6 first state of their creation [CW:Angles]
 Angles w%5ch%6 heauen com%Manded to provide [99]
 all things for me, & be my faithfull guide
 To gaine new freinds, t'appease great enimies
 To comfort my soule when I lie, or %Ys%Z rise
 shall thes 12 Innocents by thy severe
 Sentence (dreade Iudge) my sinnes great burthen beare
 shall they be damnd, and in y%5e%6 furnace throwen
 and punisht for offences, not their owne
 They saue not me, they doe not ease my paines
 when in y%5t%6 Hell th'are burnt & tied in chaines
 were they but Crownes of France I car'd not
 for most of them their naturall countries rott
 I thinke possesseth they came here to vs
 so leane so pale, so lame, so ruinous
 And how soere French Kings, most Christian be
 Their Crownes are circumsizd most Iewishlie. [CW:Or]
 Or were they Spanish stampe still traveling [100]
 That are become as Catholique as their King
 Thos vnlickt beare whelpes, vnfild Pistoletts
 that more then Cannon shott availes or letts
 w%5ch%6 necligently left vngrounded, looke
 like many angled figures in y%5e%6 booke
 of some great Couniurer, w%5ch%6 would inforce
 nature, as thes doe Iustice from her course
 w%5ch%6 as y%5e%6 soule quickens head feete & hart
 as streames like vaines run through th'earths euery parte
 Visitt all Countries & haue slylie made
 Gorgians France ruined, ragged & decayd
 Scottland w%5ch%6 knew no state proud in one day
 and mangled seauenteene headed Belgia: [CW:Or]
 Or were itt such gould, as y%5t%6 where w%5th%6 all [101]
 Almightie Chymicks from each minerall
 hauing by subtill fier a soule out puld
 are durtely and desperately guld
 I would not spitt to quench y%5e%6 fier they were in
 for they are guiltie of much haynous sin
 But shall my harmeless Angell perish shall
 I loose my gard my ease my foode, my all
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish shall be deade
 much of my able youth & lustie heade
 will vanish if thou loue, lett them alone
 for thou wilt loue less, when as they are gon
 O be content y%5t%6 some loude squeaking crier
 Well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane threadbare groate for hier [CW:May]
 May like a Diuell roare through euery streete [102]
 and gall y%5e%6 finders conscience if they meete
 Or lett me creepe to some dread Coniurer
 w%5th%6 w%5ch%6 fantastique scheames, fills mu>c<h pap%P
 w%5ch%6 hath devided heauen in Tenemts
 And w%5th%6 whores, theiues & murderers stuffe her rents
 so full, y%5t%6 though he pass them all in sinne
 he leaues himselfe no rome to enter in
 And if when all his art & time is spent
 he sayth t'will nere be found:  Oh be content
 receiue from him y%5e%6 doome vngru%Yg%Zdgeginglie
 because he is y%5e%6 mouth of destenie
 Thou see's (alas) y%5e%6 gould doth still remaine
 though itt be changd & putt & putt into a chaine [CW:So]
 So in y%5e%6 first fallen Angles resteth still [103]
 wisdome & knowledge but tis turnd to ill
 As thes should doe good workes, & should provide
 Ne%Yss%Zcessities, but now must nurse their pride
 and they are still bad Angles, mine or none
 for forme giues being, & their forme is gon
 pittie thes Angles, yett their dignities
 pass virtues power, & principallities
 But thou art resolute, thy will be done
 yett w%5th%6 such anguish as her only sonne
 the mother in y%5e%6 hungry graue doth lay
 vnto the fier thes Martirs I betray
 good soules for you giue life to euery thing
 Bad Angles for good messages you bringe [CW:Destined]
 Destined you might haue bin to such an one [104]
 As would haue loud, & worshipt you alone
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger nakednes
 yea death ere he would make your nomber less
 But I am guiltie of your sad decay
 may yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer w%5th%6 %Yyou%Z>me< stay
 But Oh thou wreched finder, whome I hate
 so much y%5t%6 I allmost pitty the state
 Gould being y%5e%6 heauiest mettall amongst %Ythos%Z all
 may my most heauy curse vpon y%5ee%6 fall
 here fettered, manacld, & hang'd in chaines
 first mayst thou be, then chaind in hellish paines
 Or be w%5th%6 forraigne gould bribd to betray
 Thy country, & faile of both, y%5t%6, and thy pay. [CW:May]
 May y%5e%6 next thing thou stops to reach, containe [105]
 poyson whose nimble fame rott thy moyst braine
 or libells or some interdicted thing
 w%5ch%6 necligently kept thy ruiyne bring
 Lust bred diseases rott thee & dwell w%5th%6 thee
 Itchie desier & no abilitie
 May all y%5e%6 hurt w%5ch%6 euer god hath wrought
 All mischeifs w%5ch%6 all Diuells euer thought
 Want after plentie pore & gowtie age
 The plagues of travellers. loue & mariage
 afflict thee & at thy liue's%Y'%Z latest moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselves to y%5e%6 present
 But I forgiue; repent thou honest man
 Gould is restoratiue restore itt can
 Or if w%5th%6 itt thou bee'st loath to depart
 because tis cordiall, would t'ware at thy hart.
