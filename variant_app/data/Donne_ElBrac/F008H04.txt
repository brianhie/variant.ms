 Not that in collour it was like thy haire
 for Armelets of that, thou maist let me weare,
 Nor that thy hand it ofte imbrac'd and kis't
 ffor soe it had that good, w%5ch%6 oft I mist,
 Nor for that sillye ould morallitye
 That as those linckes are tie'd, our loue should be
 Mourne I, that I thy 7 fold chaine haue lost
 Nor for the luck sake, but the bitter cost;
 Oh shall 12 righteous Angells w%5ch%6 as yet
 noe leaven of#%Y>f<%Z vilde Soder did admitt,
 nor yet by anie fault haue straied, and gone
 from the first state of their creation
 Angells w%5ch%6 heauen comaunded to prouide
 All thinges to me, and be my faithfull guide
 to gaine newe ffreindes to appease great Enimies
 to comfort my soule, when I lye, or rise,
 shall theis 12 Innocents by thy seuere
 sentence, dread Iudge, my sins great burthen beare?
 Shall they be damnd, and in the fornace throwne,
 and punishd for offences not their owne?
 They saue not mee, they doe >%Vnot< ease my paines
 When in y%5t%6 hell they are burnt, and tie'd in chaines
 Were they but Crownes of ffrance, I car'd not
 ffor most of them their naturall Countrey rott,
 I thinke possesseth; They come heere to vs
 Soe leane, soe la%Ame, soe pale, soe ruinous,
 And howsoer'e ffrench kinges most Christian be
 Their crownes are circumcisde most Iewishly.
 Or were they Spanish stampes still trauelling
 They>>var:That<< are become as Catholique as their kinge
 Those vn'lickt beare=whelpes, vnfilld pistoletts
 That more then Cannon shott availes, or letts,
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded, looke
 like many >>%Ym%Z<<angled figures in the booke [CW:om]
 Of some great Coniurer, w%5ch%6 would enforce [13v]
 nature, as theis doe iustice, from her course
 w%5ch%6, as the Soule quickens, head, feete, and heart
 as streames like veines run through th earths euery part
 visit all Countries, and haue slilie made
 Gorgeous ffrance ruin'd, ragged, and decaie'd
 Scotland w%5ch%6 knewe noe state prowde in one da%Aye
 And mangled 17 headed Belgia
 Or were it such gould as that wherew%5th%6a%All
 almighty chymickes from each Minerall
 hauing by subtile fire a soule outpulld,
 are durtily, and desperatelie gulld:
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in,
 ffor they are guiltie of much hainous Sinne;
 But shall my harmelesse Angells perish? shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my foode, my all?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish will be de'ad
 much of my able youth and lustyhead
 will vanish, if thou loue, let them a%Alone
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone
 Oh be content that some lowde squeaking Crier
 well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane, thredbare groat for hier
 May like a%A diuell roare through euery streete
 And gaule the finders conscience, if they meete
 Or let me creepe to some drea%Ad Coniurer
 w%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastique scenes, fullfills much paper
 w%5ch%6 haue>>var:hath<< divided heauen in tenementes
 And w%5th%6 whores, theeues, and murderers stuffd %Ytheir%Z>%Vher< rentes
 Soe full that though he passe them all in sinne
 He leaues himselfe noe roome to enter in
 And if when all his art, and tyme is spent
 He saye, twell ne're be found, (oh be content)
 receiue from him the doome vngrudginglie
 Because he is the mouth of destinie [CW:thou#saist:]
 Thou saist alas the gould doth still remaine [14]
 Though it be chaungd, and put into a%A chaine
 Soe in the first fall'ne Angells resteth still
 wisedome, and knowledge, but tis turnd to ill
 As theis should doe good workes, and should prouide
 necessities, %Jand%K[Mvar:>>but<<] nowe must nurse thy pride
 And they are still badd Angells, myne are none
 ffor forme giues being, and their forme is gone
 Pitty theis Angells yet, their dignities
 Passe vertues, powers, and principallities,
 But thou art resolute, they will be done
 yet w%5th%6 such >>%Y<<an>>%Z<< anguish a%As her onely sonne
 the mother in the hungry graue doth laye.
 Vnto the fire theis Martirs I betraye
 good soliles->>soules<; ffor yo%5w%6 giue life to euerythinge
 Good Angells; ffor good messages yo%5w%6 bringe
 Destin'd yo%5w%6 might haue bin to such a%A one
 as would haue lou'd, and worship'd yo%5w%6 alone;
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer, hunger, nakednesse
 yea death, e're he would make yo%5r%6 nomber lesse;
 But I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sad decaie,
 May yo%5r%6 >>%Vfew<< fellowes w%5th%6 me longer staye
 But oh thou wretched finder whom I hate
 Soe much that I allmost pitty thy estate
 Gould being the heauiest mettle amongst all 
 May my most heauie curse vpon thee fall
 Here fetterd, manicled, and hangd in chaines
 first mayst thou be, then chaind to hellish paines
 or be w%5th%6 forraigne gould bribde' to betray
 thy Countrey, and faile both of that, and thy paye,
 maye the next thing thou stoopst to reach conteine
 poison, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst braine
 or libells, or some interdicted thinge
 w%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bringe [CW:om]
 Lustbred diseases rott thee, and dwell w%5th%6 thee. [14v]
 Itchie desire, and noe abillitie
 may all the hurt that euer gold hath wrought
 all mischeifes, w%5ch%6 all diuells euer thought
 want after plenty, poore, and gowtie age
 The plagues of Trauellers, loue, and marriage
 Afflict thee, and at thy liues latest moment
 maie thy swolne sins themselues to thee present
 But I forgiue, repent thou honest man,
 Gould is restorative, restore it then
 Or if w%5th%6 it thou beest loath to depa%Art
 Because tis cordiall, would twere at thy heart.
 Finis
