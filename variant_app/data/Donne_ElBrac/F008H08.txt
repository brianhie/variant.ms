 Not that in colour it was like thy haire,
 ffor armeletts of that thou mayst lett mee weare,
 Not that thy hand it oft imbrac'te & kist
 ffor soe it had that good w%5ch%6 oft I mist,
 Nor for that silly old morality
 That as those linkes are tyde our loue should bee,
 Mourne I that I thy seaven-fold chayne haue lost,
 Nor for the luck-sake; but the bitter cost.
 Oh shall twelue righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
 Noe Leaven of vile soulder did admitt,
008.H08.011om
 
 Angells, w%5ch%6 heauen commanded to provide
 All things for mee, & be my faithfull guide,
 To gaine new frends, t'appease great enemyes,
 Comfort my Soule whether I lye or rise,
 Shall these twelue Innocents by thy severe
 Sentence (dread Iudge) my sinnes great burthen beare?
 Shall they be damn'd, & to the furnace throwne
 And punnisht for offences not their owne?
 They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paynes
 When in that hell th'are burnt, & ty'de in chaynes: [CW:om]
 Were they but Crownes of ffrance I cared not, [63r]
 ffor most of them their naturall Country rott
 (I thinke) possesseth;  they come here to vs
 Soe leane, soe pale, soe lame, soe ruinous;
 And howsoe're ffrench ffrench Kings most Christian bee
 Their crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly:
 Or were they Spanish stamps still travelling
 That are become as Catholike as their Kinge,
 Those vnlickt Beare whelpes, vnfill'd d Pistoletts
 That more then Canon shott availes, or letts,
 Which negligently left vnroundly, looke
 Like many angled figures in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer, w%5ch%6 would inforce
 Nature, as these doe iustice from her course;
 Which, as the Soule quickens head, feete, & heart,
 As streames, like veines run through th'earths ev'ry part,
 Visitt all Countryes, & haue slyly made
 Gorgeous ffrance ragged, ruin'd & decayd
 Scotland, w%5ch%6 knew noe State, prun'd in one day
 And mangled seaventeene-headed Belgia.
 Or were it such gold as that wherewithall
 Almighty Chymicks from each Minerall
 Hauing by subtle force a soule out-pul'd
 Are durtily & desperatly gul'd
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in
 ffor they are guilty of much hainous sinne.
 But shall my harmeless Angells perish?  shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my all?
 Much hope, w%5ch%6 they should nourish will be dead;
 Much of my able youth, & lusty head [CW:om]
 Will vanish.  If thou loue, let them alone, [63v]
 But thou willt loue mee less when they are gone.
 Oh be content that some loud squeaking Cryer
 Well pleasd with one leane, thread-bare groate for hire
 May like a Devill roare through every street
 And gall the finders conscience, if they meet:
 Or lett mee creepe to some dread Coniurer
 Which with fantasticke scheames fills full much paper,
 W%5ch%6 hath divided heaven in Tenements,
 And with whores, theeues, & murderers stuffs her rents
 Soe full, that though hee pass them all in sinne
 Hee leaues himselfe noe roome to enter in,
 And if when all his Art & tyme is spent
 Hee say twill ne're be found: oh be content,
 Receiue the doome from him vngrudgingly
 Because he is the mouth of destiny.
 Thou sayst alas the gold doth still remaine
 Though it be chang'd & putt into a chaine,
 Soe in those first-falne Angells resteth still
 Wisedome & knowledg but tis turn'd to ill:
 As these should doe good workes & should provide
 Necessityes but now must nurse thy pride;
 And they are still bad Angells, myne are none,
 ffor formes giue being, & their formes are gone:
 Pitty these Angells yett, their dignityes
 Pass vertues, powers, & principalityes;
 But thou art resolute, thy will be done;
 Yet with such anguish, as her only sonne
 The mother in the hungry graue doth lay,
 Vnto the fires these Martyrs I betray. [CW:om]
 Good soules, for you giue life to every thinge, [64r]
 Good Angells, for good messages you bring,
 Destind you might haue bin to such a one
 As would haue lou'd, & worshipt you alone;
 One, that would sufer hunger, nakednes
 Yea death, e're he would make your number less;
 But I am guilty of y%5r%6 sad decay,
 May your few fellowes longer with mee stay.
 But thou o wretched finder whom I hate
 Soe, that I almost pitty thyne estate
 Gold being the heavyest mettall amongst all
 May my most heavy curse vpon thee fall;
 Here fetterd, manacled, & hang'd in chaynes
 ffirst mayst thou bee, then tyde to hellish paynes,
 Or be by forraine gold bribd to betray
 Thy country, & faile both of that & pay;
 May the next thinge thou stoopst to reach contayne
 Poison whose nimble fume rott thy moist brayne;
 Or libells, or some interdicted thinge
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bringe;
 Lust-bredd diseases rott thee, & dwell with thee
 Itchy desire & noe ability;
 May all the hurt that euer gold hath wrought,
 All mischeifes w%5ch%6 all Devills ever thought,
 Want after plenty, poore & gouty age,
 The plagues of travailers, loue & marriage
 Afflict thee:  & at thy liues latest moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee present.
 but I forgiue:  repent thou honest man,
 Gold is restoratiue, restore it then,
 Or if with it thou beest loath to depart
 Because tis cordiall, would twere at thy heart.|
