 Not that in colour it was like thy haire
 (for armeletts of that, thou mayst let me weare)
 nor that thy hand it oft embrac'd and kissd',
 (for so it had that good w%5ch%6 oft I missd')
 nor for that silly old Morality
 that as those linkes are ty'd, our loues should be
 mourne I, that I thy seaven-fold chayne haue lost,
 nor for the luckes sake, but the bitter cost.
 Oh!  shall twelue righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
 no leaven of vile souder did admitt,
 nor yet by any taint haue stray'd or gone
 from the first state of theire Creation,
 Angells, w%5ch%6 heav'n com%Manded, to provide
 all thinges for me, and be my faithfull guide,
 to gaine newe frendes, t' appease greate enemies,
 to comfort my Soule when I ly or rise:
 shall those twelue Innocents by thy seuere
 Sentence (dread Iudge) my sinnes great burden beare?
 Shall they be damnd' and to the furnace throwne,
 and punishd' for offences not theire owne?
 They saue not me, they do not ease my paines,
 when in that Hell th'are burnt and t'yde in chaines.
 were they but Crownes of ffrance, I cared not
 for most of them theire naturall Countrey rott
 (I thinke) possesseth, they come heere to vs
 soe leane, soe pale, soe lame, soe ruinous:
 and howesoe're ffrench kinges most christian be,
 theire Crownes are circumcisd' most Iewishly:
 Or were they Spanish stampes still travellinge,
 they are become as Catholicke as their kinge; [CW:om]
 Those vnlickt' beare-whelpes, vnfild' pistoletts [162v]
 that more then Cannon-shotts, avayle, or letts,
 w%5ch%6 negligintly left vn-roundly, looke
 like many angled figures in the booke
 of some greate Coniurer, w%5ch%6 cold inforce
 Nature, as these do Iustice, from her course;
 w%5ch%6, as the Soule quickens head, foote and hart:
 as streames, like vaines, runne through th'earths eu%5r%6y part,
 visitt all Countreyes, and haue slily made
 Gorgeous ffrance, ragg'd, ruind', and decay'd,
 Scotland, w%5ch%6 knewe noe state, proude in one day,
 and mangled seaventeene=headed Belgia:
 or were it such gold, as that, wherewithall
 Allmighty chymickes from each mynerall
 havinge by suttle fire a Soule out-pulld',
 and durtily and desperately gulld;'
 I would not spitt to quench the fire th'are in,
 for they are guilty of much hainous sinne.
 But shall my harmeles angells perish?  shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my all?
 much hope, w%5ch%6 they should nourish, wilbe dead,
 much of my able youth and lusty head
 will vanish, yf thou loue, let them alone,
 but thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone.
 Oh!  be content that some loud-squeaking Cryer,
 well pleasd' with one %Yleane%Z#leane thredbare groate for hyer
 may, like a Deuill, roare through euery streete,
 and gall y%5e%6 ffinders Conscience, yf they meete;
 Or let me creepe to some dread Coniurer
 w%5ch%6 with fantastique scheames fullfill much paper, [CW:om]
 w%5ch%6 hath devided Heavn' in Tenements, [163r]
 and with whores, theiues, and murderers stuft his[var:>her<] rents
 So full, that though he passe them all in sinne,
 he leaues himselfe no roome to enter in:
 and yf when all his Art and time is spent
 he say, 'twill n'ere be found, oh, be content;
 receiue the Doome from him vngrudgingly,
 because he is the mouth of Destiny.
 thou sayst, alas, the gold doth still remaine,
 though it be chang'd, and put into a chayne:
 soe in those first falne Angells resteth still
 wisedome and knowledge, but tis turnd' to ill,
 as these should do good workes, and should prouide
 necessityes, but nowe must nurse thy pride:
 and they are still bad angells; mine are none,
 for forme giues beinge, and theire forme is gone.
 Pitty these Angells, yet theire Dignityes
 passe vertues, powers and Principalityes.
 but thou art resolute, thy wilbe done;
 yet with such anguish, as her only sonne
 the mother in the hungry graue doth lay,
 vnto the fire, these Martyrs I betray.
 Good Soules!  for you giue life to euery thinge:
 Good Angells!  for good messages you bringe,
 destind' you might haue byn to such a one
 as would haue lou'd and worship't you alone;
 one w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger, nakednes,
 yea death, ere he would make your nu%Mber lesse;
 but I am guilty of your sad decay,
 may your fewe fellowes longer with me stay.
 But thou, o wretched finder, whome I hate
 So much, as I, almost pitty thy state; [CW:om]
 Gold being the heaviest mettle amongst all, [163v]
 may my most heavy curse vpon thee fall,
 heere fettred, manacld' and hang'd in chaynes
 first mayst thou be, then chayn'd in hellish paines,
 or be with forraine gold bribd', to betray
 thy Countrey, and faile both of that and pay.
 may the next thing thou stoopst to reach, containe
 poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst brayne;
 or libells, or some interdicted thinge,
 w%5ch%6 negligently kept, thy ruine bringe:
 Lust-bred diseases rott thee, and dwell with thee
 itchy desire, and no ability:
 may all the hurt w%5ch%6 euer gold hath wrought,
 all mischeifs, w%5ch%6 all Deuills euer thought,
 want after plenty, poore and gowty age, 
 the plagues of travellers, Loue, and marriage
 afflict thee; and at thy lifes la>t'<st moment,
 may thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee present.
 But I forgiue.  Repent then, honest man;
 Gold is restoratiue, restore it than;
 or yf with it thou beest loth to part,
 because 'tis Cordiall, would 'twere at thy hart.
