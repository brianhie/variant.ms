 Not that in colour it was like thy Hayre
 For Armeletts of that, thou mayst lett mee weare,
 Nor that thy hand it oft embrac'd, and kiste,
 For soe it had the Good, w%5ch%6 oft I miste.
 Nor for the seely old Moralitye
 That as those linckes are tyed, our loues shold bee,
 Mourne I, that I thy seuen=fold chayne haue lost,
 Nor for the lucke sake, but the bitter Cost;
 Oh shall xii righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yett
 No leauen of vilde Solder did admitte,
 Nor yett by any falt haue stray'd, or gone
 From the first state of theyre Creation;
 Angells w%5ch%6 Heauen commanded to provide
 All thinges to mee, and bee my faythfull guide;
 To gayne new frindes, to appease greate Enimies,
 To comforte my Soule, when I lye or rize.
 Shall these xii Innocents by thy seueare
 Sentence (Dread Iudge) my Sins greate burden beare?
 Shall they be damn'd and in the furnace throwne?
 And punished for Offences not theyre owne?
 They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paynes,
 When in that Hell they are burnt, and tyed in Chaynes.
 Weare they but Crownes of France, I cared not
 For most of them theyre naturall country rott
 I thincke possesseth, they come here to Vs [CW:om]
 So leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinous. [13v]
 And howsoere French Kings most Christian bee,
 Theyre Crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly.  
 Or were they Spanish stamps, still trauayling,
 That are become as Catholique as theyre King,
 Those vnlickd Bearewhelpes, vnfild Pistoletts,
 That more then Cannot shott avayles, or letts,
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded, looke
 Like many angled figures in the booke
 Of some greate Coniurer, w%5ch%6 wold enforce
 Nature, as these doe Iustice from her course
 W%5ch%6 as the Soule quickens head, feete, and hart
 As Streames, like veines runns through th'Earths euery Part.
 Visitt all Countryes, and haue slily made
 Gorgeous France ruind, ragged, and decayde.
 Scottland w%5ch%6 knew no State, Proud in One day
 And mangled Seauen-teene headed Belgia.
 Or weare it such Gold, as that wherew%5th%6all
 Allmightye Chemicks from each Minerall,
 Having by subtle fyre a Soule outpuld
 Are durtily, and desperately gul'd.
 I wold not spitt to quench the fyre, they weare in.
 For they are guilty of much heynous Sin.
 But shall my harmelesse Angells perish? Shall
 I loose my Guard, my Ease, my food, my All?
 Much hope, w%5ch%6 they shold nourish, wilbe dead [CW:om]
 Much of my able youth, and lustihead [14]
 Will vanishe; Yf thou loue, lett them alone
 For thou wilt loue lesse, when they are gone.
 Oh be Content, that some loude squeaking Cryer,  
 Well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane thred-bare grote for hyre,
 May like a Devill rore through euery streete,
 And gall the finders Conscience, if they meete.
 Or lett mee creepe to some dread Coniurer
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastique Scheames fullfills much paper.
 W%5ch%6 hath devided Heauen in Tenements,
 And w%5th%6 whores, theeues, and Murtherers stuft her rents
 So full, that though he passe them all in Sin,
 Hee leaues himselfe no roome to enter in.
 And if when all hys Art, and Time is spent,
 Hee say, t'will nere be found, oh be content.
 Receaue from him the doome vngrudgingly,
 Because he is the mouth of Destinye.
 Thou sayst, alas the Gold doth still remayne
 Though it bee changd, and put into a Chayne.
 So in the first faln Angells restesth still,
 Wisedome and knowledge, but tis turn'd to ill.
 As these shold doe good workes, and shold provide
 Necessityes, but now must nurse thy Pride.
 And they are still bad Angells, mine are none
 For forme giues beeing,  and theyre forme is gone.
 Pitty these Angells, yett theyre dignityes [CW:om]
 Passe Virtues, Powers, and Principalityes. [14v]
 But thou art resolute; Thy will be done,
 Yett w%5th%6 such anguish, as her only Sonne
 The mother in the hungry graue doth lay,
 Vnto the fyre these Martyres I betraye.  
 Good Soules, for you giue life to euery thinge,
 Good Angells, for good Messages you bringe.
 Destind you might haue bin to such a One,
 As would haue lou'd, and worshipt you alone.
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer hungar, Nakednes,
 Yea death, ere he wolde make your number lesse.
 But I am guilty of your sad decay.
 May your few fellowes longer w%5th%6 mee stay.
 But oh thou wretched finder, whom I hate
 So much, that I almost pitty thy State.
 Gold beeing the heauyest mettall amongst all,
 May my most heauy Curse vpon Thee fall;
 Here fetterd, manacl'd, and hang'd in Chaynes
 First mayst thou bee then chaynd in hellish paynes.
 Or be w%5th%6 forayne Gold, bribd to betraye
 Thy Country, and fayle both of that, and thy Pay.
 May the next thinge, thou stoopst to reach, contayne
 Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst brayne.
 Or libells, or some interdicted thinge
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept, thy ruine bringe.
 Lustbread Diseases rott Thee, and dwell w%5th%6 Thee
 Itchye Desyre, and no Abilitye.[CW:om]
 May all the hurt, w%5ch%6 euer Gold hath wrought [f.14b]
 All mischeifes, w%5ch%6 all Devills euer thought.
 Want after Plentye, poore and Gowty Age,
 The Plagues of Trauaylers, Loue, and Maryadge,
 Afflict Thee, and at thy lifes latest moment
 May thy swolne Sinns themselues to Thee present.
 But I forgiue; Repent then honest Man
 Gold is Restorative, Restore yt than.
 Or if w%5th%6 yt thou beest loth to depart
 Because t'is Cordyall, wold t'weare at thy hart.|
