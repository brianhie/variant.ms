 Not that in colour it was like thy haire [f. 9]
 for armletts of that thou mayest lett me weare
 nor that thy hand itt oft embrace->embrac>%Ye%Z<t and kiste
 for soe it had that good w%5ch%6 oft I miste
 nor for that sillie old Morralitie
 that as those %Yp%Zli>>n<<nks were tyed our loue should be
 Mourne I that I thy seauen fould chine have lost
 Nor for the lucke sake but the bigger cost
 Oh shall twelue righteous Angells w%5ch%6 as yett
 No leauen of vile soder did admitt
 Nor yet by any fault have strayed, or gone
 ffrom the first state of there creatyon
 Angelles w%5ch%6 heaven commanded to provide
 all thinges to me and be my faithfull guide
 To gaine new freindes to appease greate enimies
 to comforth my soule when I lie or rise
 Shall these twelue Inocents by thy severe
 Sentence dread Iudge my sinnes greate burden beare
 Shall they be damnd, and in the furnace throwne
 And punished for offences not there owne
 they save not me, they doe not ease my paines
 When in that hell, they are burnt and tyed in cheanes
 where->w>>a<<ere they but crownes of ffrance I cared not
 ffor moste of them there naturall contrie rott
 I thinke possesseth! they come >>%Y<<t>>%Z<<here to vs
 So leane so pale so lame so >>r<<*>>%Vu<<ainous
 And howsoever french kinges most christian bee
 there crownes are circumcised moste Iuishly
 Or were they Spanish stamps still trauailinge
 That are become as catholique as there kinge
 Those vnlicked bare whelps vnfild pistoletts
 that more then cannon shott availes or lettes
 w%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded looke
 like many Angled figures in the booke
 Of some greate coniurer w%5ch%6 would insorce
 Nature as these doe iustice from there cource
which as the soule quickes head feet and hart
 of streames like vaines runnes through the earth every part
 Visitt all contries and have slilie made
 Gorgeous ffrance ruined rugged and decayed
 Scottland w%5ch%6 knew no state proud in one day
 And mangled seaventeene headed Belgia
 Or were it such gold as that we>>a<<re w%5th%6all
 Almightie chimicks from each Minerall
 havinge by subtill fier a soule out puld
 are durtilie and desparatly guld
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in
 ffor they are guiltie of much haynous sinne
 But shall my harmeles Angells perish shall
 I loose my gaurd my head my foot my all?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should norish will be dead
 much of my able youth and lustie head
 will vanish if thou loue lett them alone
 ffor thou wilt love me lesse when they are gone
 Oh be content that some loud speakinge->>squakinge< cryer
 Well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane thred bare groat for hier
 May like a deuell rore through every street [f. 9v]
 and gall the fingers->>finders< conscience if he meet
 Or lett me meete w%5th%6 some dread coniurer
 w%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantasticke Sceanes fills full much paper
 W%5ch%6 haue deuided Heauen in tenementes
 And w%5th%6 whores theaues and Murtherers stuft his rentes
 So full that though he passe them all in sinne
 he leaues himselfe no roome to enter in
 And if when all his art and tyme is spent
 he say twill neere be found  (oh be content
 Receive from him the doome vngrudgingly
 Because he is the mouth of destinye
 Thou saist alas the gould doth still remaine
 though it be chainged and put into a cheane
 Soe in the first fallen Angells resteth still
 Wisdome and knowledge but tis turned to ill
 As these should doe good workes and should provide
 Necessaties but now must nurse thy pride
 And they still bad Angelles mine are none
 ffor forme giues beeinge and there forme is gone
 Pittie these Angells yet there dignities
 passe vertues powers and principallities
 But thou art resolute thy will be done
 yet w%5th%6 such anguish as her onely sonne
 The Mother in the hungrie grave doth lay
 vnto the frier these Martirs I betray
 good soules for you give lite->li>>f<<e to every thinge
 good Angelles for good messages you bringe
 desdaind->des>>t<<ind you might have been to such a one
 As would have loved and worshippt you alone
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger Nakednes
 Yea death ere he would make your number lesse
 %V>>but I am gultie of your sade decay,<<
 May your fellowes w%5th%6 me longer stay
 But oh thou wreched finder whome I hate
 So much that I almoste pittie thy estate
 Gould beinge the heauiest mettell amongst all
 May my moste heauie course vpon the fall
 Here fettred manacled and hanged in cheanes
 first maiste thou be then chaind to hellish paines
 or be w%5th%6 forraigne gould bribd to betray
 thy conterie and faile boath of that and thy pay
 May the next thinge thou stopot->sto>%Vo<pst to reach contayne
 poyson whose nimble fume rott thy moyste brane
 Or lybells or some interdicted thinge

 The plages of trauellers loue and Marriage
 Afflict thee, and at thy liues last moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselves to the present
 But I forgive repent thou honest man
 gould is restorytive restore it then
 Or if w%5th%6 it thou beest loath to departe [f. 10]
 Because tis cordiall would twere at thy hart
