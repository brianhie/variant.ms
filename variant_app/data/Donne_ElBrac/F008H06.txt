 Not that in colour it was like thy hayre
 (ffor armlets of that thou mayst let mee weare)
 Not that thy hand it oft embrac'd and kist
 (ffor so it had that good w.%5ch%6 oft I mist)
 Nor for that silly old Morality
 That as those linkes are tyd, our hearts should bee
 Mourne I that I thy seuenfold chayne haue lost,
 Nor for the lucks sake, but the bitter cost
 Oh shall 12 righteous Angels, w.%5ch%6 as yet
 No leauen of vile soader did admitt
 Nor yet by any taint haue strayd or gon
 ffrom the first state of theyr Creation
 Angels w.%5ch%6 heauen com%Maunded to prouide
 All things for mee, and bee my faythfull guide,
 To gayne new frinds, t'appease greate enemyes
 To comfort my soule when I lye or rise,
 Shall these 12 Innocents, by thy severe
 Sentence, Dread Iudge) my sinnes greate burden beare?
 Shall they bee burnt, and in the fornace throwne
 And punishd for offences, not theyr owne?
 They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paynes
 When as in Hell th'are burnd and ty'd in chaynes.
 Were they but Crownes of France I cared not
 ffor most of them theyr naturall countrys rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come heere to vs
 So leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinous.
 And how-soe're French kings most Christian bee
 Theyr Crownes ar circumcisd most iewishly [CW:Or--]
 Or were they Spanish stamps still trauelling [81r]
 That are become as Catholique as theyr king
 Those vnlickd Bearewhelps, vnfil'd pistolets
 That more then Canon shott avayles or lets
 W.%5ch%6, negligently left vnrounded, looke
 Like many angled figures in the booke
 Of some greate coniurer, w.%5ch%6 would in force
 Nature, as these doe Iustice, from her course.
 W.%5ch%6, as the Soule, quicken, head, feete, and heart
 As streames, like vaynes, run through th'earths ev%5r%6y p%Pt
 Visite all Countryes, and haue slyly made
 Gorgeous France ragged ruynd and decayd
 Scotland, w%5ch%6 knewe no state, proude in one day,
 And mangled seventeene headed Belgia.
 Or were it such Gold as that wherewithall
 Almighty Chymicks from each minerall
 Hauing by subtill fire a soule out-puld
 Ar durtily, and desperately gulld.
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in
 ffor they %Ywere->>ware<%Z>%Var< guilty of much haynous sinne.
 But shall my harmelesse Angels perish?  Shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my foode, my all?
 Much hope w.%5ch%6 they should nourish would bee dead
 Much of my able youth and lusty-head 
 Will vanish, if thou, loue, let them alone
 ffor thou will loue mee lesse when they ar gon.
 Oh bee content that some lowde squeaking cryer
 Well pleasd with one leane threadbare grote for hyre
 May like a Diuell roare through every streete
 And gall the finders conscience if they might->>meete<.
 Or let mee creepe to some dread coniurer
 Which with fantastique sceames fulfills much paper
 Which hath diuided %Jheauen%K>var:Hell< in Tenements
 And with whores theeues and murderers filld her Rents [CW:So]
 So full that, though hee passe them all in sinne [81v]
 Hee leaues him selfe no roome to enter in
 And if, when all his Art and time is spent
 Hee say t'will ne're bee found, oh bee content,
 Receaue the doome from him vngrudgingly
 Because hee is the mouth of destiny.
 Thou sayst, alas, the gold doth still remayne
 Though it bee changd and put into a chayne:
 So in those first fall'n Angels resteth still
 Wisedome and knowledge, but tis turnd to ill
 As these should doe good workes, and should prouide
 Necessityes, but now must nurse thy pride,
 And they are still badd Angels, mine are none
 ffor forme giues beeing, and theyr forme is gon
 Pitty these Angels yet, theyr dignities
 Passe vertues, powers, and principalityes.
 But thou art resolute, thy will bee donne
 Yet with such Anguish as his onely sonne
 The mother in the hungry Graue doth lay
 Vnto the fire these Martyrs I betray.
 Good Soules, for yo%5u%6 giue life to every thing
 Good Angels, for good messages you bring.
 Destind you might haue bin to such a one
 As would haue lou'd and worshipd yo%5u%6 alone
 One w.%5ch%6 would suffer hunger, nakednesse.
 Yea death, ere hee would make yo%5r%6 number lesse.
 But I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sadd decay
 May yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer with mee stay.
 But thou o%C wretched finder whome I hate
 So as I almost pitty thy estate.
 Gold being the heauyest mettall amongst all
 May my most heauy curse vpon thee fall. [Heere-]
