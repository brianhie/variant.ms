 Not that in colour it was like thy haire
 ffor armeletts of that thou mightst let me weare
 Nor that thy hand it oft embracd and kisst
 ffor so it had that good that oft I misst
 Nor for that silly old morality
 That as those Linkes are knitt o%5r%6 loue should be
 Mourne I that I thy seauenfold chaine haue lost
 Nor for the linkes sake but the bitter cost
 O shall 12 righteous Angells which as yet
 No Leaven of vitider->>villder< solder did admitt
 Nor yet by any fault haue straid and gone
 ffrom the first state of her creation
 Angells which heauen commanded to prouide
 All things for me to be my faithfull guide
 To gaine new frends, to appease great enemyes
 To comfort my soule whither I lye or rise
 Shall these 12 Innocents by thy severe
 Sentence (dread Iudge) my sinnes great burden beare
 Shall they be damnd and in the ffurnace throwne
 And punisht for offences not ther owne
 They saue not me they doe not ease my paines [f.44v]
 When that in Hell they're burnt and tyed in chaines
 Were they but Crownes of ffrance I cared not
 ffor most of those ther naturall Countreys rott
 I thinke possesseth they come here to vs
 So leane so pale so lame so ruinous
 That howsoere ffrench Kings most Christian be
 There Crownes are circumcisd most Iewishly
 Or were they Spanish stampes still travailing
 That are become as Catholicke as there Kinge
 Those vnlickt Bear-welps, vnfiled Pistolets
 That more then Cannon shott auailes or letts
 That negligently left vnrounded looke
 Like many Angled figures in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer that would enforce
 Nature, as these doe Iustice from her course
 That like the soule runnes through th'head, feet & hart
 As streames like veines %Yth%Z runne though th'earths each p%Pt
 Visit all Countryes and haue slyly made
 Gorgeous ffrance raggd ruind and decayd
 Scotland that knew noe face proud in one day
 And mangled 17%5tene%6 headed Belgia
 Or were it such gold as that wherewithall
 All-mighty Chimicks from each minerall
 hauing by subtle fire a soule out pulld
 Are durtyly and desperately gulld
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they are in
 ffor they are guilty of much hainous sinne.
 But shall my harmelesse Angells perish? %Yall%Z shall
 I loose my guard my ease my life my all?
 Much hope that they now nourish will be dead
 Much of my able youth and liuelyhood.
 Will vanish if thou loue let them alone [f.45]
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone.
 O be content that some loud-sqeaking Cryer
 Well pleasd with one leane thread-bare groate for hire
 May like a deuill roare through euery street
 And gall the finders conscience as they meet.
 O let me creepe to some dread Coniurer
 That with fantasticke Scheames fullfills much paper
 That hath diuided heaven in Tenements
 And with whores theeues and murtherers stuffes his tents->>rents<
 So full that though he passe them all in sinne
 he leaue himselfe noe roome to enter in
 And if when all his art and time is spent
 He say twill nere be found yet be content
 Receiue from him tht doome vngrudgingly
 Because he is the mouth of Destinye
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But thou art resolute thy will be done
 Yet with such anguish as her only sonne
 The mother in the hungry graue doth lay
 Vnto the fire these Martirs I betray
 Good soules for you giue life to euery thing
 Good Angells for good messages you bring
 Destind you might haue bene to such an one
 That would haue loued and worshipt you alone
 One that would suffer hunger nakednesse
 Yea death but he would make you number lesse
 But I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sad decay
 May yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer with me stay.
 But o%C thou wretched finder whom I hate
 So much I almost pitty thine estate
 Gold being the heauyest mettall amongst all
 May my most heauy curse vppon the fall
 Here manicled, fetterd and tyed in chaines
 ffirst mayst thou be then chaind in hellish paines
 Or be with forraine gold bribed to betray [f.45v]
 Thy Country and faile both of it and pay
 May y%5e%6 next thing thou stoopst to reach containe
 Poison whose nimble fume rott thy moist braine
 Or Libells or some interdicted thing
 Which negligently kept thy ruine bring
 Lust-bred diseases rott thee.  And dwell with thee
 Itchy desires and no ability
 May all the euills that gold euer wrought
 All mischiefes that all deuills euer thought
 Want after plenty, poore and gouty age
 The plagues of trauellors and marrigge->>marriage<
 Afflict thee and at thy last moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to the present.
 But I forgiue repent thee honest man
 Gold is restauratiue restore it than.
 But if from it thou bee'st loth to depart
 Because tis Cordiall would twere at thy hart
