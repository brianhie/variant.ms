 Not that in couller itt was like thy haire,
 For armeletts of that, thou maiest lett me weare. [CW:Nor.|]
 Nor that this hand, itt oft embrac't and ki>>s<<'t, [18r]
 For so itt had thatt good, w%5ch%6 oft I mist;
 Nor for that seelie olde morallitie,
 That as those lincks are tyed, our loue shoold be,
 Mourne I, that I this 7 fould chaine haue lost,
 Nor for the luck sake, butt the bitter cost;
 Oh shall 12 righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yett
 Noe leauen of vile sodder did admitt>>,<<
 Nor yett by anie falt haue strayed and gon.
 From the first state of theire creation;
 Angells w%5ch%6 heauen commaunded to prouide
 All things to me, and be my faithfull guide
 To gaine newe freinds, to appease great enimies,
 To comfort my soule, when I >>l<<ye >>o<<r rise>>.<<
 Shall theise 12 innocents by thy seuere
 Sentence (dread Judge) my sinns great burden beare,
 Shall they be damn'd and in the fornace throwne,
 And punnis'd for offences not their owne.
 They saue not me; they doe not ease my paines,
 When in thatt hell, they are burnt, and tye'd in chaines. [CW:Were.|]
 Were they butt crownes of Fraunce, I car'd not. [18v]
 ffor moste of them theire naturall countrie rott
 I thinck possesseth, they come heere to vs
 [ind.4.sp]So leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinous.
 And howsoe're french Kings most christian be
 Theire crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishlie;
 Or weare they spannish stamps, still trauailing,
 That a>>re<< become as catholick as theire King,
 Those vnlic'kd beare whelps, vnfil'd pistoletts,
 Thatt more then Cannon shott, auailes, or letts,
 Which negligentlie left vnrounded, looke
 Like manie Angled figures in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer, which would enforce
 Nature, as theise doe Iustice from hir course,
 Which, as the soule quickens head, feet, and hart,
 As streames like veines runs through th'earths euerie part. 
 Visitt all countries, and haue slyelie made
 Gorgeous Fraunce ruind', ragged and decaid'e.
 Scottland w%5ch%6 knewe no state, Proud in one daie,
 And mangled seauenteene headed Belgia. [CW:Or.|]
 Or were itt such golde, as that whe>>re<< with all [19r]
 Almightie Chemicks from each Minerall.
 Hauing by subtile fier a soule outpu'ld
 Are durtelie and desperatelie gulld'.
 I woulde not spitt to quench the fyre they wea>>r<<e in.
 For they are guiltie of much heinous sinne.
 Butt shall my harmeles Angells perish?  shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my all?
 Much hope which they shoold nourish wilbe dead,
 Much of my able youth, and lusty#head->>>lively#hood<<,
 Will vanish; yf thou loue, let them alone.
 For thou wilt loue the lesse when they are gone.
 Oh be content, that some loude squeaking Cryer,
 Well pleas'd with one leane thredbare groat for hyer,
 Maie like a deuill roare through euerie street
 And gall the finders conscience, yf they meete.
 Or lett me creepe to some dread Coniurer
 Which with fantastique scheames fullfills much paper.
 Which hath deuided heauen in tenements,
 And with whores, Theeues, and murderers, stuft his rents. [CW:So#full.|]
 So full, that though he passe them all in sinne [19v]
 He leaues himself no roome to enter in.
 And if, when all his art, and tyme, is spent,
 He say twi'll nere be found, oh be content.
 Receaue from him the doome vngrudginglie,
 Because he is the mouth of destenie.
 Thou saist, alas, the golde dooth still remaine
 Though itt be chang'd, and putt into a chaine.
 Soe in the first falne Angells resteth still,
 Wisedome and knowledge, butt ti's turned to ill.
 As theise shoolde doe good works, and shoold prouide
 Necessities, butt nowe must nurse thy Pride.
 And they are still bad Angells, mine are none
 Forme giues being, and theire forme is gone.
 Pittie theise Angells, yett theire dignities
 Pass>>e<< virtues, powers, and principalities;
 Butt thou art resolute; thy will be done>>.<<
 Yett with such anguish, as hir onlie sonne,
 The mother in the hungrie graue dooth lay>>,<<
 Vnto the fire theise Martirrs I betray. [CW:Good.|]
 Good soules, for you giue life to euerie thing, [20r]
 Good Angells, for good messages you bring.
 Destind you might haue beine to such a one>>,<<
 As woolde haue lou'd and worshipt you alone;
 One, w%5ch%6 woolde suffer hunger, Nakednesse
 Yea death, ere he woulde make your number lesse>>.<<
 Butt I am guiltie of your sad decaye,
 Maie your fewe fellowes longer with me stay>>.<<
 Butt oh, thou wretched finder, whome I hate
 Soe much, that I pittie thy estate;
 Golde being the heauiest mettall amongst all
 Maie my most heauie curse vpon thee fall.
 Heere fette'rd, manac'ld and hang'd in chaines
 First maiest thou be, then chain'd in hellish paines.
 Or be with foraigne golde, bribd'e to betray
 Thy Countrie, and faile both of that, and thy paye.
 Maye the next thing, thou stoopst to reach, conteine
 Poison, whose nimble fume, rott thy moist braine.
 Or libells, or some intedicted thing.
 Which negligentlie kept, thy ruyne bringe. [CW:Lust=bred.|][miscatch]
 Lustbred diseases rott thee, And dwell with thee, [20v]
 Itchie desire, and no abilitie.
 Maie all the hurt, w%5ch%6 euer golde hath wrought
 All mischeifs, which all deuills euer thought>>.<<
 Want after plentie, poore and goutie age,
 The plagues of trauailers, loue, and mariadge.
 Afflict thee, and att thy lifes latest moment,
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee present.
 Butt I forgiue.  Repent thou honest man,
 Golde is restoratiue;  Restore itt then.
 Or if with itt, thou beest loath' to depart
 Because ti's cordiall; wou'ld twe'are at thy hart.
