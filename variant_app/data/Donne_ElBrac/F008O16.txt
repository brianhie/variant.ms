Not y%5t%6 in Color it was like thy hayre
For Armletts of y%5t%6, thow canst let me weare;
Nor that thy hand it oft >embract< & kist
Thowgh soe it had y%5t%6 good, y%5t%6 oft I mist;
Nor for y%5t%6 silly, old, morality
That as those Linkes are tyed, o%5r%6 Loves showld bee
Mowrne I; y%5t%6 I thy seven fold chayne have lost
Nor for y%5e%6 Luck sake; but y%5e%6 bitter Cost.
Oh, shall 12 righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
No leaven of vild Soulder did admitt
Nor yet by any taint, or plague, have gone
From y%5e%6 first state of theyr Creation;
Angells, w%5ch%6 heaven co%Mmanded to provide
All things for me, & be my faithfull Guide;
To gayne new freynds, t'appease great Enemyes
To comfort my Soule, when I lye, & rise:
Shall these 12 Innocents, by thy severe
Sentence, (dread Iudge) my Sinns great sentence \beare?
Shall they be damn'd, & in y%5e%6 fornace throwne
And punish'd for offences not theyr owne?
They save not me, they doe not ease my Paynes
When in y%5e%6->>y%5t%6< Hell th'are burnt, & tydd->>tyed< in chaynes:
Were they but Crownes of %1France%2 I cared not
For most of them, theyr naturall Cowntry rott
I thinke possesseth; they come heere to vs
So lame, so leane, so pale, so ruinous:
And howsoe're French Kgs: most Christian be
Theyr Crownes arre Circumcisd most %1Iewishly%2;
Or were they spanish stampe still travelling
That are become as Catholick as theyr kinge.
Those vnlick't Beare-whelpes, vnfilde Pistoletts [f.31
That, more then Co%Mmon Shott, avayles, or letts:
W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrownded, lookes
Like many angled figures in y%5e%6 Bookes
Of some dread Coniurer; w%5ch%6 wold enforce
Nature, as these doe Iustice, from her cowrse;
W%5ch%6 as y%5e%6 Sowle quickens, head, feet & heart
Or streames like vaynes, run throwgh th'Earths every part
Visitt all Cowntryes >%^%5&%6< have slily made
Gorgeous frances ragged, ruind & dea->>decayd<;
%1Scotland%2, w%5ch%6 knew no state, prowd in one day
And mangled seventeene-headed %1Belgia%2:
Or were it such gold as y%5t%6, wherwithall
Almighty Chimickes from each Minerall
Having w%5th%6 subtile fire a sowle owt pul'd
Are durtily & desperately gulld;
I wold not spitt to quench y%5e%6 fire th'were in
For they are guilty of much heinous sinne.
But shall my harmeless Angells perish all?
I loose my guard, my ease & eooe->>eke< my all:
Much hope w%5ch%6 they did nourish wilbe dead
Much of o%5r%6 able yowth & Lusty-head
Will vanish, if thow love but them alone
For thow wilt love me less when I am gone:
Oh be content y%5t%6 some lowd-squeaking Cryer
Well pleasd with one leane thred-bare groate for him->>hire(%1var%2: >%^%5hire%6<
May like a Devill roare throwgh every streete
And gall y%5e%6 finders conscience, if they meete:
Or lett me creepe to some great Coniuror
W%5ch%6 with fantastike Schemes full fills much pap%P
W%5ch%6 hath divided heaven in Tenements
And with Whores, Theeves, & Murderers, stufft his Rents
So full; that thowgh he passe them all in Sinne [f. 31v
He leaves himselfe no roome to enter in:
And if (when all his Art & Time is spent)
He say, 'twill nere' be fownd; Oh be content
Receave y%5e%6 doome from him vngrudgin>%^%5g%6<ly
Because he is y%5e%6 Mowth of Destiny:
Thow say'st (alas) y%5e%6 Gold doth still remayne
Thowgh it be chang'd & putt into a Chayne;
So in those first ffallen Angells resteth still
Wisdom & knowledge, but 'tis turnd to ill;
All these showld doe good workes, & showld p%Pvide
Necessaries; but now must nurse thy Pride;
And they are still bad Angells, myne are none
For forme gives being, & theyr forme is gone:
Pitty these Angells, yet their dignityes
Pass virtews, powers & Principialityes.
But thow art resolute, thy wilbe done
Yet with such anguish, (as her only sonne
The mother in y%5e%6 hungry grave doth lay)
Vnto y%5e%6 fire these Martirs I betray:
Good Sowles! for yow give life to every thinge
Good Angells! for good messages yow bringe:
Destind yow might have beene to such a one
As wold have lovd & worshipt yow alone;
One w%5ch%6 wold suffer hunger, nakedness
Yea Death, ere' he wold make y%5r%6 number less.
But I am guilty of y%5r%6 sad decay
May y%5r%6 few fellowes longer with me stay
But Oh thow wretched finder, whom I hate
So much; as I almost pitty thy Estate
Gold being heaviest mettall amongst all
May my most heavy Curse vpon thee fall
Heere fetterd, manacled, & hangd in Chaynes [f.32
First mayst thow be; then chaind in Hellish paynes;
Or be w%5th%6 forreine gold brib'd to betray
This->>Thy< Cowntry, & fayle both in y%5t%6, & pay:
May y%5e%6 next thinge thow stoopest at, contayne
Poison, whose nimble fume, may rott thy brayne;
Or Libells, or some interdicted thinge
W%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bringe:
Lust-bred diseases rott thee; & dwell w%5th%6 thee
Itchy desires, but no ability:
May all y%5e%6 hurt y%5t%6 gold hath ever wrowght
All Mischeifes, w%5ch%6 all Devills ever thowght:
Want after Plenty; poore & gowty age
The plagues of Travailers; Love & Marriage
Afflict thee; & at thy lives last Moment
May thy swolne Sinns themselves to thee present;
But I forgive; repent thow honest Man
Gold is restorative, restore it than
But if with it thow bee'st loth to depart
Becawse tis Cordiall, wold t'were at thy Heart.|
