 Not that in colour it was like thy haire,
 For a***letts%>a>rme<letts of that thou mayst let me weare:
 Nor that thy hand it ofte embrac'd & kist
 For so it had that good w%5ch%6 ofte I mist
 Nor for that silly old moralitye
 That as those links are ty'd our loues should be,
 Mourn I that I thy seuen=fold chaine haue lost;
 Nor for the lucks sake, but the bitt%5r%6 cost.
 Oh shall twelue righteouse angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
 Noe leauen of vile soder did admitt?
 Nor yet by any taint haue strayd or gone,
 From the first state of theire cration?
 Angells, w%5ch%6 heauen com%Maunded to prouide
 All things to me and be my faithfull guide;
 To gaine new freinds t'apease greate enimyes,
 To comforte my soule when I lye or rise
 Shall theise twelue innocents, by thy seuere
 Sentence, (dread iudge), my sinns great burthen beare?
 Shall they be damn'd? & in the fornace throwne
 And punish't for offences not theire owne?
 They saue not me, they doe not ease my paines,
 When in that hell th'are burnt, & ty'd in Chaines.
 Were they but crownes of %1France%2 I cared not
 For Most of them theire Naturall country rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come heer to vs
 So leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinouse [CW:And]
 And howsoe're %1French=Kings%2 most Christian be, [p.2]
 Their Crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly.
 Or were they Spanish stamps still trauayling
 That are become as Catholicke as theire Kinge
 Those vnlick't bear=whelps, vnfil'd pistolettes
 That more then Cannon shott avayles or lettes;
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded looke
 Like many angled ffigures in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer, who would enforce
 Nature as these doe iustice from her course;
 W%5ch%6 (as the soule quickneth head, feet, & harte 
 As streames like vaynes run through th'earths euery parte)
 Visitte all countries, & haue slily made,
 Gorgeouse %1France%2 ragged, ruin'd & decay'd
 %1Scotland%2, w%5ch%6 knew noe state proude in one day,
 And mangl'd seuenteen headed %1Belgia%2.
 Or were it such gold as that wherw%5th%6
 Almightye Chymicks from each minerall
 Hauing by subtile fire a soule out pul'd
 Are durtely and desperatly gull'd.
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in
 ffor they are guiltie of much heinouse sinn.
 But shall my harmlesse angells perish? shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my All?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish wilbe dead
 Much of my able yeouth and lustie=heade.
 Will vanishe; if thou loue lett them alone
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone. [CW:om]
 Oh be content that some lo*d%>>lou'd< squeaking crye%5r%6 [p.3]
 Well pleas'd w%5th%6 one leane threed=bare groate for hire
 May like a Diuell rore through euery street
 And gall the finders conscience, if hee meete.
 Or let me creep to some dread coniurer
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastiq%Q scheames fullfills much paper
 W%5ch%6 hath deuided heauen in tenements
 And w%5th%6 whores, theeus and murderers stuf'd his rents
 So full that though he passe them all in sinne
 He leaues himselfe noe roome to enter in:
 And if when all his art and tyme is spent
 He say 'twill neer be found, oh be contente
 Receiue the doome from him vngrudgingly
 Because he is the mouth of destenye:
 Thou sai'st alasse the gold doth still remayne
 Though it be chang'd and put into a Chayne.
 So in those first falne Angells, resteth still
 Wisdome & knowledge, but 'tis turn'd to ill.
 As these should doe good workes & should prouide 
 Necessities but now must nurse thy pride:
 And they are still bad angells: myne are none
 ffor forme giues beeing, & theire forme is gone.
 Pittie these Angells yet, theire dignities
 Past vertues, powres & principalityes
 But thou art resolute thy wilbe done
 Yet w%5th%6 such anguish as her only sonn
 The Mother in the hungrie graue doth lay
 Vnto the fire these martyrs I betraye. [CW:om]
 Good soules! for yow giue lyfe to euery thinge. [p.4]
 Good angells! for good messages yow bringe.
 Destin'd yow might haue been to such a one
 As would haue lou'd & worshipp'd yo%5w%6 alone.
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger nakednesse
 Yea death ere he would make yo%5r%6 number lesse.
 But I am guiltie of yo%5r%6 sad decay
 May yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer w%5th%6 me stay.
 But oh thou wretched finder whome I hate
 So much as I almost pittie thy state.
 Gold beeing the heauiest mettle among'st all
 May my most heauye curse vppon the fall.
 Heere fettred, manacl'd & hang'd in chaines
 ffirst may'st thou be, then chayn'd to hellish paynes
 Or be w%5th%6 forraigne gold brib'd to betray
 Thy countrie, & fayle both of it & thy paye.
 May the next thing thou stoop'st to r%5e%6ache, contayne
 Poyson whose nimble fume rott thy moyst brayne
 Or libells, or some interdicted thinge
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bringe.
 Lust bred diseases rott & dwell w%5th%6 thee:
 Itchy desire and noe abilitye
 May all the hurte w%5ch%6 euer gold hath wroughte
 All mischeifes w%5ch%6 all deuills eu%5r%6 thoughte
 Wante after plentie, poore and goutie age
 The plauges of trauaylers loue & mariage. [CW:om]
 Afflicte thee and at thy lyfes latest momente [p.5]
 May thy swolne sinns themselus to thee p%5r%6sente.
 But I forgiue:  Repent then honest man!
 Gold is restoratiue, restore it then.
 Or if w%5th%6 it thou beest loath to departe
 Because 'tis cordiall would 'twere at thy harte.|
