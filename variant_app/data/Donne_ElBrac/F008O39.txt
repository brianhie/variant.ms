Not y%5t%6 in coulour it was like thy haire
(For Armletts of y%5t%6 thou mightst lett mee weare
Nor y%5t%6 thy hand it oft embrac't & kist
(For soe it had y%5t%6 good w%5ch%6 oft I mist
Nor for y%5t%6 sillye old moralitye
(That as these links are tyed our loves should bee
Mourne I y%5t%6 I thy sevenfold chaine have lost
Nor for y%5e%6 lucke sake, but y%5e%6 bitter cost.
Oh shall 12 righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yett
Noe leaven of vild soader did admitt
Nor yett by any fault have strayd or gone
From y%5e%6 first state of their creation,
Angells, w%5ch%6 heaven co%Mmannded to p%Pvide
All things to mee, to bee my faithfull guide
To gaine new frends, to appease great enemies
My soule to co%Mfort when I lye or rise
Shall these 12 innocents by thy seveare
Sentence (dread Iudge) my sinnes great burden beare               
Shall they bee damn'd, & in y%5e%6 furnace throwne                
And punisht for offences not their owne?                          
They save not mee, they doe not ease my paines                    
When in y%5t%6 hell they are burn't, & tyed in chaines.           
Weare they but crownes of France I cared not                      
ffor most of these their naturall countrye rott                    
I thinke possesseth they come heere to vs                         
Soe pale, so lame, so leane, so ruinous.                          
And howsoere french kings most Christian bee                      
Their crownes are circu%Mcizd most Iewishlie.                     
Or weare they Spannish stampes still travailing                   
That are become as Catholicke as their king                       
Those vnlickt bearewhelps, vnfild pistoletts                      
That more then Ca%Mnon shott availes or letts
That negligently left vnrounded looke                             
Like many angled figures in y%5e%6 booke                          
Of some great coniurer y%5t%6 would enforce                      
Nature, as these doe Iustice, fro%M her course                    
That (like y%5e%6 soule runnes through head feete & heart [f.152rev
As streames like vaynes runnes through earths every p%Pte)       
Visitt all countryes, & have slilye made                          
Gorgious ffrance ragged, ruind & decaid                           
Scotland, w%5ch%6 knew noe state proude in one day             
And mangled 17 headed Belgia.                                     
Or weare it such gold as that wherew%5th%6all                     
Allmighty Chimicks fro%M each minerall

I would not spitt to quench y%5e%6 fier therin                    
For they are guiltie of much hainous sinne                        
But shall my harmles Angells p%Pish, shall                        
I loose my guarde, my life, mine ease, my all?                    
Much hope y%5t%6 they should nourish will bee dead                
Much of mine able youth & livelyhead                              
Will vanish; if thou love lett them alone                         
For tho%5u%6 wilt love mee lesse when they are gone.              
Oh bee content y%5t%6 some lowd squeaking crier                   
Well pleasd w%5th%6 one thinne threadbare groat for hyer          
May like a divell roare through every streete                     
And gall y%5e%6 finders co%Mscience if they meete.                
Or lett mee creepe to some dread coniurer                         
That w%5th%6 fantastique scheames doth keepe a sturre            
And hath devided heaven in tenements                              
And w%5th%6 whoores, theeves, & murderers stuft his rents         
So full, y%5t%6 though hee passe them all in sinne                
Hee'le leave him selfe noe roome to enter in                      
And if when all his arte & time is spente                         
Hee say twill neare bee found; Oh bee co%Mtent                   
Receave fro%M him y%5e%6 doome vngrudginglie                      
Be'cause hee is y%5e%6 mouth of destenye                          
Thou saiest (alas) y%5e%6 gold doth still remaine                 
Though it bee chaungd & putt into a chaine

But thou art resolute, thy will bee done
Yet w%5th%6 such anguish as her onely sonne
The mother in y%5e%6 hungrye grave doth laye
Vnto y%5e%6 fier these Martyrs I betraye
Good soule! for yo%5u%6 give life to everye thinge
Good Angells! for good messages yo%5u%6 bringe
Destind yo%5u%6 might have beene to such a one
That would have lovd & worshipt yo%5u%6 alone
One y%5t%6 would suffer hunger, nakednes,
Yea death ere hee would make yo%5r%6 number lesse.
But I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sadd decay
May yo%5r%6 few fellows longer w%5th%6 mee staye.
But o%C though wretched finder, whome I hate
Soe y%5t%6 I allmost pittie thy estate
Gold beeing y%5e%6 heaviest mettall amongst all
May my most heavy curse vpon thee fall
Heere, fetterd, manacled, & tyed in chaines
ffirst maist tho%5u%6 bee, then chained to hellish paines
Or bee w%5th%6 forraine gold bribd to betraye
Thy countrey & faile both of that & paye.
May y%5e%6 next thinge tho%5u%6 stoopest to reach co%Mtaine
Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moist braine
Or, libles or some interdic'ted thinge
W%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bring.
Lustbredd diseases rott thee & dwell w%5th%6 thee
Itchie desire & noe abilitie
May all y%5e%6 ill y%5t%6 gold hath ever wrought
All mischeifs y%5t%6 all divells ever thought
Want after plentye, poore & gowty age
The plagues of travailers, love, marriadge,
Afflict thee, & more, at thy lives last moment
May thy swolne sinnes themselves to thee p%Psent.
But I forgive repent thee honest man
Gold is restorative, restore it than
But if from it thou beest loath to departe
Because tis cordiall, would t'were at thy harte.
