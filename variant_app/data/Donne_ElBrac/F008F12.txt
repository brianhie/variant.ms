 Not that in colour it was like thy hayre
 Armeletts of that thou still mayst lett mee weare
 Nor that thy hand it oft imbrac'd and kisst
 ffor soe it had that good that oft I mist
 Nor for that silly old Mortality
 That as those lylkes->ly>n<kes ar tyed our loues should bee
 Mourne I that I thy seauen fould Chayne haue /(lost 
 Not for the lynkes sake, but for the bitter cost
 O shall twelfe righteous Angells which are yett
 Noe leauen of vild soder did admitt
 Nor yet by any taynt haue staynd or gone
 ffrom the first state of their Creation
 Angells which Heauen commanded to prouide
 All things for mee and bee my faithfull guide
 To gaine new friends to appease new enemyes
 To comfort my soule when I fly or arise
 Shall these twelfe In%Mocents by the seuere
 Sentenc't->>Sentenc'e< great Iudge my Sin great burthen beare
 Shall they bee burnt or in the furnace throwne
 And punished for offences not their owne
 They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paynes
 When in that hell they are burnt and tyed in chaines
 Were they but Crownes of ffrance which come to vs
008.F12.024om
008.F12.025om
 Soe leane, soe pale, soe lame, soe ominous
 And howsoere ffrench Kings ** most Christian **>be<
 Their Crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly
 Or were the Spanish stampes still havilling
 That are become as Catholique as their King. [CW:Those]
 Those vnlikt whelpes, those vnfild pistoletts [p.13]
 That more then Canon shott avayles or letts
 Which negligently left vnrewarded looke
 Like many angled figures in the Booke
 Of some great Coni%Y**%Z>ur<er which would enforce
 Nature, as this doe Iustice from the course
 Which as the Soule, quickens Head, ffoote, and Heart,
 As streames like veynes runn through Earths euery part
 Visit all Countreys and have slily made
 Gorgeous ffra>%Vn<ce ra>%Yg%Z<'d ruined and decay>%Ye%Z'<d
 Scotland which knewe no state p*>%5r%6<oud in one day
 And mangled seauenteene headed Belgia
 Or were but it such go>u<ld, as were withall
 Allmighty Chimicks from each Minerall
 Handling by subtle fire a Soule out pulld
 Are durt>i<ly and desperately gulld
 I would spitt to %Yqu#q%Z quench the fire they were in
 ffor they are guilty of much haynous Sinne
 But shall my harmeles Angells perish? shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my seed, my all
 Much hope which they should nourish will bee dead
 Much of thy able youth and lusty head
 Will rauish vanish if thou Loue see them alone
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse when I am gone
 Oh bee content that some loud speaking Cryer
 Well pleas'd with one leane thred bare groate to hier
 May like a diuell runn into euery streete
 And gall the f%Y*%Z>i<nders conscience if they meete
 Or lett me creepe to some dread Coniurer+[SYD CHANGED J TO I]
 Who with phantastique charmes fill full much paper
 Which hath deuided Heauen in Tenement%Ye%Zs
 And with whores, Theeues, and Murtherers->Mur>d<erers stuffe their Tents [CW:Soe]
 Soe full that though hee passe them all in si%Y*%Z>n<ne [p.14]
 Hee leaues himselfe noe ro>o<me to enter in
 And if when all his Art and Tyme is spent
 Hee say twill n'ere be found. Oh be content
 Receaue from him thy do%Y*%Z>o<me vngrudginly
 Because hee is the mouth of destiny
 Thou s%Y*%Z>a<ist alas the gould doth still remayne
 Though it be chang'd and putt into a Chayne
 Soe in those first fall'n Angells resteth still
 Wisdome, and knowledge but tis turn'd to ill
 As these should doe good workes and should prouide
 Necessities, but now must nurse their pride
 And they are still bad Angells myne or none
 ffor %Y***%Z forme giues being and their forme is gone
 Pitty these Angells yett their dignities
 Passe virtues, Powers, and Principallities
 But thou art resolute thy will bee done
 Yett with such anguish %Yav%Z->>as< her onely Sonne
 The mother in the humane graue %Ydoth%Z doth lay
 Vnto the fire the Martyrs I betray
 Good Soules giue for you giue life to euery thing
 Good Angells for good messages you bring
 Destin'd you might haue bin to such an one
 As liu'd and euer worshipped you alone
 One which could suffer hunger, nakednes
 Yea death ere he would make your number lesse
 But I am guilty of your sad decay
 Oh may your fellowes longer with mee stay
 But thou oh wretched finders whom I hate
 Soe much as I doe pitty thy estate
 Gould being heauiest mettall among all
 May my most heauy curse vpon the fall [CW:Here]
 Here, fettered, mannacled, and hang'd in chaynes [p.15]  
 ffirst mayst thou bee, then chayned in hellish paynes
 Or bee with forraigne Go>u<ld bribd to betray
 Thy Countrey faile of it and of thy pay,
 May the next thing thou stoopst to reach conteyne
 Poyson whose nimble fame rott thy moyst brayne
 Or libells or some interdicted thing
 Which negligently keept, thy ruine bring
 Lett bred deseases rott, and dwell with the
 Itchy desire but no abilitie
 May them, which ouer Gould haue wrought
 All mischeifes which all divells ere thought
 Want after a plenty and a gowty age
 The plague of Trauellers, loue, and marriage
 Afflict the, and att thy liues last monent
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to the present
 But I forgiue, repent thou honest man
 Gould is restoratiue, restore it than
 Or if with it thou beest loa%Yr%Zth to depart
 Because tis Cordiall, would twere att thy heart.
