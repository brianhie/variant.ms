 Not that in co>>*<<lo>>%Vu<<r it was like thy hay**>>re<<
 For annulets of that thou migh>>%Ve<<st let mee were
 Nor y%5t%6 thy hand it oft embrac%Ye%Z>>'<<d & kist
 For soe it had that good which oft I miste
 Nor for that silly olde mor>>%Y<<t>>%Z<<alitie
 That as the>>i<<r%Ye%Z linckes are knit>>,<< our loues should bee [CW:om]
 Morne I y%5t%6 I %Yseuen%Z>thy< seauen fould chaine haue lost [f.40]
 Nor for y%5e%6 luck*s, [om] but the bitter cost
 O shall twel%Y*%Z>>%Vve<< righteous [a%>>A<]ngells which %Yhaue%Z>%Vas< yet
 No>>%Y<<e>>%Z<< heauen of vilder solder did ad mitte
 Nor yet by any fault haue straid, or gone
 From y%5e%6 first state of the>>i<<r>>%Ye%Z<< creation
 Angells which heauen commaunded to prouide>>%Y<<d>>%Z<<
 All things to mee to bee my faithfull guide
 To gaine new freinds, prepare great enemies,
 To comfort my soule when I ly and rise
 Shall thes>>e<< twelue innocents by thy seuere
 Sentence (dread iudge) my sinns great burden beare
 Shall they bee damn%Ye%Z>>'<<d & in the furnace burne
 And punish%Ye%Z>>'<<d for offences not there owne
 They saue not mee they doe not ease >>my<< paynes
 when that in hell their%>thei>>**'re<< burnt & ty>>'<<d>>%Y<<e>>%Z<< in chaines
 were they but crownes of f%>>F<rance I dared%>>>c<<ared not
 For most of those the>>i<<r naturall cuntries rott
 I thinke posseseth they come here to us
 So>>%Y<<e>>%Z<< pale, so>>%Y<<e>>%Z<< lame, so leane, so>>%Y<<e>>%Z<< ru[o%>>>i<<]nouse,
 And howsoere French Kings most Christian bee
 The>>i<<r>>%Y<<e>>%Z<< crownes are circ[o%>>>u<<]msised most Iewishly.
 O were they spanish stampes still traue[r%>>l<<]ing
 That are become as Catholike as the>>i<<r Kinge
 Those vnlick>>%Y*%Z<<t beare=whelps, vnfil>>'<<d>>%Ye%Z<< pisto>l<lets
 That more than cannon shot auaile, or letts
 That negligently left unrounded looke
 Like many Angelde figuers in the booke [CW:om]
 Of some great coniurer that would enforse [f.40v]
 Nature as thes>>e<< doe iustice from theire course
 That like y%5e%6 soule runs through y%5e%6 head, feete, hart
 As streemes like veines run[e%>>>n<<] through y%5e%6 earths each parts[sic]
 Writs all countries and haue %Y>syl<%Zslylie made
 Gorgeous France ruind, ragged and decaied
 Scotland which knew noe face>>;<< proude in one day
 And mangled 17:%5tene%6 headed Belgia
 O were it such goulde as y%5t%6 where with all
 Almightie chimikes from each min>n<erall
 Hauing by subtill fi>e<r%Ye%Z a soule out pulled
 Or durtelie & desperately gulled
 I would not spitt to squench y%5e%6 fier there in
 For they are guiltie of such h>>%Ye%Z<<ainous sinn.
 But shall my harmlesse Angells perish! shall
 I loose my g>u<arde, my life, my%>m>>i%5ne%6<< ease, mine all
 Much hope that they which nourish will be dead
 Much I%>>of< my able youth & liuely head
 will vanish: if thou loue lett them alone
 For thou wilt loue mee lesse when they are gone
 O bee content y%5t%6 some loud %Ycrying%Z>speaking< cryer
 weele please with one leane threadbare groat for hire
 May like a diuell roare through euerie streete
 And gall y%5e%6 finders con>>s<<cience if they meete.
 O let mee creepe to some dread coniurer
 That with fantasticke sceemes%>sc>>h<<emes fill full much pa>>%Y*%Z<<per
 That hath diuided heauen in lineaments [CW:om]
 That with whoores, theeues, and murderers %Y>stuffes#ten<%Z %Y>consents<%Z >>stuffes<< [f.41]
 Soe full, that though hee passeth all in sinn
 Hee leaues him selfe not rome to enter in
 And if when all his arte and time is spent
 Hee say twill neare%>ne>>e<<re bee found; yet bee content
 Receiue from him y%5e%6 doome vngr[a%>>>u<<]tchingly
 Because hee is the mouth of dest[e%>>>i<<]n[ie%>>>y<<]

 Good soules for you giue life to euery thinge

 The plag>>u<<e of trauilors loue, marriages
 Afflict thee; & at thy [om] last moment
 May thy swolne sinns them selues to thee present
 But I for giue repent thee honest man
 Goulde is restoratiue, restore it then
 But if from it thou beest loath to depart
 Because tis cordiall, would twere at thy hart.
