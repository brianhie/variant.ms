 Not that in Colour it was like thy hayre
 (for armeletts of that thou mayst lett me weare)
 nor that thy hand it oft embrac'd & kist
 (for so it had that good which oft I mist)
 nor for that silly old moralitye
 That as those linkes are ty'd, our hearts should bee
 mourne I that I thy seauen fold chayne haue lost
 nor for the lucks sake, but the bitter cost.
 Oh shall 12 righteous angells, which as yet
 no leauen of %Jvild%K[Mvar:>%Jvile%K<] soader did admitt
 nor yet by any taint hau*e[Mvar:>haue<] strayd or gon
 from the first state of their creation,
 Angells which heauen com%Maunded to prouide
 All thinges for me & bee my faithfull guide
 To gaine new freinds, t'appease great Enemies
 To comfort my soule when I lye or rise,
 Shall these 12 Innocents, by thy seuere
 Sentence (dread Iudge) my sinnes great burden beare?
 Shall they be burnt & in the furnace throwne,
 And punishd for offences not their owne?
 They saue not me, they do not ease my paines
 when as in Hell th'are burned & ty'd in chaynes.
 Were they but crownes of France I cared not
 for most of them their naturall countryes rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come heere to vs
 so leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinous. [CW:om]
 And howsoere French kinges most Christian bee [43v]
 Their Crownes are circumcisd most Iewishly.
 Or were they Spanish stamps still travelling
 That are become as Catholique as their kinge
 Those vnlickd Beare whelps, vnfil'd Pistoletts
 That more then Cannon shott avayle, or letts
 Which, negligently left vnrounded, looke
 Like many angled figures in the booke
 of some great Coniurer, which would inforce
 Nature, as these doe Iustice, from her course.
 Which, as the Soule, quicken head, feet, & heart
 As streames, like vaynes runne through th'earths euery part,
 Visit all countryes, & haue sly=ly made
 Gorgeous France ragged, ruin'd & decay'd, 
 Scotland, which knew no state, proud in one day,
 And mangled seauenteene headed Belgia.
 Or were it such gold as that wherwithall
 Almighty Chymicks from each minerall
 Hauing by subtill fire a soule out-pull'd
 Are ductily & desperately gull'd;
 I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in
 for they are guiltye of much haynous Sinne.
 But shall my harmlesse Angells perish? shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my All?
 Much hope which they should nourish would be dead
 Much of my able youth & lusty-head
 will vanish, if thou, Loue, let them alone
 for thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gon.
 oh be content that some loud squeaking Cryer
 well pleasd with one leane threadbare groat for hyre,
 may like a Deuill roare through euery street
 And gall the finders conscience if they meet. [CW:>>Or#lett<<]
 Or lett me creep to some dread Coniurer [44r]
 which with phantasticke scheames fulfills much paper
 which hath diuided %JHell%K[Mvar:>%JHeauen%K<] in Tenements
 And with whores theeues & murtherers filld her rents
 So full, that though he passe them all in sinne
 He leaues himselfe no roome to enter in,
 And if, when all his Art & time is spent
 He say, 'twill n'ere be found, oh be content
 Receaue the doome from him vngrudgingly%Ylye%Z
 Because he is the mouth of destinye.
 Thou sayst, alas, the gold doth still remaine
 Though it be changd & putt into a chayne.
 So in those first falne Angells resteth still
 wisdome & knowledge, but tis turnd to ill;
 As these should do good works & should prouide
 necessaryes, but now must nurse thy pride.
 And they are still bad Angels, mine are none
 for forme giues being, & their forme is gon.
 Pitty these Angells yet, their dignityes
 Passe virtues, Powers, & Principaletyes.
 But thou art resolute, thy will be done.
 Yet with such anguish, as her only sonne
 The mother in the hungry graue doth laye,
 Vnto the fire these Martyrs I betray.
 Good soules, for you giue life to euery thinge
 Good Angells, for good messages you bringe.
 Destin'd you might haue beene to such an one
 As would haue lou'd & worshipd you alone
 One which would suffer hunger, nakednes,
 Yea death, ere he would make your number lesse.
 But I am guilty of your sadd decay
 may your few fellowes longer with me stay. [CW:om]
 But thou o%C wretched finder whom I hate [44v]
 So as I almost pitty thine estate;
 Gold being the heauyest mettall amongst all
 May my most heauy curse vpon thee fall.
 Heere fetterd manacled, & hangd in chaynes
 ffirst mayst thou bee, then ty'd to hellish paynes.
 Or bee with forraigne gold bribd to betray
 Thy country, & faile both of that & pay.
 may the next thinge thou stoop'st to reach, containe
 Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst braine.
 Or Libell, or some interdicted thinge
 which negligently kept, thy ruine bringe.
 Lust-bredd diseases rott thee, & dwell with thee
 Itchy desire & no abilitye.
 May all the hurt which euer gold hath wrought,
 All mischeifes which all Deuills euer thought,
 want after plentye, poore & gouty Age,
 The plagues of Travell, loue, & mariage,
 Afflict thee, & at thy liues last moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee p%5r%6sent,
 But I forgiue, repent thee honest man
 Gold is restoratiue, restore it than:
 or if with it thou beest loath to depart
 Because tis cordiall, would 'twere at thy heart.
