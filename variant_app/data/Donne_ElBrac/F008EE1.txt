 Not that in colour it was like thy hayre,
 For arm-letts of that, thou mayst let mee weare;
 Nor that thy hand it oft embrac't, and kist,
 For so it had that good, which oft I mist;
 Nor for that silly old Morality,
 That as these linkes are ty'de; our loues should bee;
 Mourne I; that I thy seau'n fold Chayne haue lost
 Nor for the luck-sake; but the bitter cost.
 O shall twelue righteous Angells, which as yet,
 No leuen of vilde Soder did admitt;
 Nor yet by any taint haue strayde, or gon,
 From the first state of theyr Creation:
 Angells, which heauen com%Maunded to prouide
 All things for mee, and bee my faithfull guide;
 To gayn new friends, t'appease great Enemyes,
 My soule to comfort, when I lye, or rise:
 Shall th*** twelue In%Mocents, by thy s*uer*
 Sentence, dread Iudge, My Sinnes great burthen bear.
 Shall %Xbe%Ythey be damn'd, and in the furnace throe%Lone
 And pun%Misht for Offences not theyr owne?
 They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paynes,
 When in that hell they'r burnt; and ty'de in Chay[%1missing%2]
 Were they but Crownes of frau%Mce, I cared not,
 For most of them theyr nat'urall country-rott,
 I thinke, possesseth; they come here to vs
 So leane, so lame, so pale, so ruinous:
 That h****ere fre**h kings most Christian bee
 Theyr Crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly.
 Or were they Spanish stampes, still trauayling,
 That are become as Catholique, as theyr King;
 Those vn-lickt Beare-whelps, vnfy'lde pistolett*
 Which more then Can%Mon-shott avayles, or letts;
 Which negligently left vn-rounded, looke
 Like many-angled figures, in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer; that would enforce                   
 Nature, as these do Iustice, from her course:                
                                                            
                                                            
                                                            
                                                            
                                                            
                                                            
 Or were it Gold, such as that wher-withall [1v]              
 Almighty Chimicks, from each Minerall,                       
 Hauing by subtle fire a Soule outpull'd,                    
 Are durtily, and desperatly gull'd:                          
 I would not spitt, to quench the fire they were in,          
 For they are guilty of much haynous Sinn.                    
 But shall my harmles Angells perish? shall                    
 I loose my food, my ease, my guard, my all?                  
 Much hope which they would nourish, will bee dead,           
 Much of my able youth, and hasty-head                        
 Will vanish; if thou loue, let them alone,                   
 For thou wilt loue mee less, when they are gone.             
 O%C bee content, that some loud-squeaking Cryer,             
 Well-pleas'd with one leane threed-bare groat, for hyre,     
 May like a Deuill, roare through eu'ry street:               
 %Y**#pull%Z>And gaue< the fynder's conscience, if they meet. 
 Or let mee creep to some %Y****%Z>dread< Coniurer,                     
 That with fantastique Scenes fills much paper;               
 That hath diuided Heauen in%Y**%Z Tenements,                       
 And with Whores, Theeues; and Murd'rers, stuft his rents     
 So full, that though hee pass them all in Sinn,               
 Hee leaues himself no roome to enter in.                      
 And, if when all his Art; and time is spent,                  
 Hee say, t'will ne're bee found, %Ybut%Z>O< bee content!               
 Receaue the doome from him vn-grudgingly,                     
 Because hee is the mouth of Destiny.

 Vnto the fire these Angells I betray.                        
 Good Soules! for you giue life to eu'ry thing;               
 Good Angells! for good messages you bring;
 Destin'd you might haue bene to such a one,                  
 As would haue lou'd, and worshipt you alone;
