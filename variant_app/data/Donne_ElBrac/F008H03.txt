 Not that in Colour it was like thy haire
 ffor amulets of that thou might lett me weare
 Nor that thy hand it oft imbrac'd and kiss'd
 For soe it had that good w%5c%6h oft I mis't
 Nor for that silly old moralitie
 That as these linkes are knitt our loue should bee
 Mourne I, that I thy seauen-fold Chaine haue loste
 Nor for the luck-sake, but the bitter cost,
 O, that>>var:shall<< Twelve Righteous Angells w%5c%6h as yet
 Noe leauen of vilder solder did admitt
 Nor yet by anie faute haue stray'd or gone
 From their firste state of %YDr%ZCreation
 Angells w%5c%6h heauen Commaunded to provide
 All thinges to mee to bee my faithfull guide
 To gaine new freindes, to appease greate Enimyes
 To Comforte my soule when I lye or rise
 Shall these Twelve Innocents by thy seuere
 Sentence (Dread Iudge) my sins greate burthen beare
 Shall they be damn'd and the ffurnace throwne
 And punnish'd for offences not their owne
 They saue not mee:  they doe not ease my paines
 When in that Hell they are burnt and tyed in Chaines
 Were they but Crownes of ffrannce I cared not
 For moste of these their naturall Contries rott
 I thinke posses, for here they come to vs
 Soe pale, soe lame, soe leane, soe ruinous
 And howsome're ffrench Kinges moste Christian bee
 Theire Crownes are Circumcisd moste Iewishly
 Or were they Spanishe stamps still trauailinge
 That are become as Catholike as their Kinge
 Those vnlick't beare-whelpes, vnfil'd pistolets
 That more then Cannon shot availes or letts
 That negligently left vnrounded, looke
 Like manie Angell'd Figures in the Booke
 Of some greate Coniurer that would enforce
 Nature all>>var:as<< these doe Iustice from her Course [CW:om]
 W%5c%6h a[t>>var:s<<] the soule quick[nesse>>var:ens<<] head, feet, and hearte [5v]
 As streames like vaines run throughe the Earths' eache parte
 visit>>%Y<<s>>%Z<< all Countreys, and haue slylie made
 Gorgeous Frannce ruin'd, ragged and decaye'd
 Scotlannde w%5c%6h knew noe state proude in one day
 And mangled seauenteene-headed Bellgia
 Or were it suche Gold as that therewithall
 Allmightie Chymickes from eache Minerall
 Haveinge by subtill fier a soule out pull'd
 Are dirtily and desperately gull'd
 I would not spitt to Quenche the fier therein
 For they are guilty of suche heynous sinne
 But shall my harmlesse Angells perrishe? Shall
 I loose my Guard, my life, mine ease, mine all?
 Muche hope that they should nourishe will be dead
 Muche of my liuely youthe and liuely=head
 Will vanishe; if thou loue lett them alone
 For thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone
 O bee content that some loud squeakeinge Cryer
 Well pleas'd with one leane thrid=baire groate for hire
 May like a Diuell roare throughe euery streete
 And gall the finders Conscience if they meet.
 O lett me Creep to some dreade Coniurer
 That with Phantastique Schemes fullfills much paper
 That hathe devided heav'n in Tenements
 And with Theeus, Whores, and Murtherers stuff't Tents
 Soe full that thoughe he passe them all in sinne
 Hee leaues himselfe noe roome to Enter in
 And if when all his arte and Tyme is spent
 Hee say t'will ne're be founde; yet be content
 Receiue from him the Doome vngrudginglie
 Because he is the mouthe of Destinie.|
 Thou say'st alas the Gold dothe still remaine
 Thoughe it bee chang'd and put into a Chaine
 Soe in the first fall'en Angells resteth still
 Wisdome and Knowledge, but t'is turn'd to ill 
 As these should doe Good workes, and should prouide
 Necessityes, but nowe muste nurse thy pride
 And they are still bad Angells; mine are none
 For forme giues beinge; and theire forme is gone
 Pittie these Angells, yet their dignities
 Passe Vertues, Powers, and Principalityes
 But thou art resolute; Thy will be done
 Yet with suche anguishe as her onely Sonne.| [CW:The#Mother]
 The Mother in the hungrie Graue dothe laye [6r]
 Vnto the fier these Martyres I betraye
 Good soules, for you giue life to euery thinge
 Good Angells for good Messages you bringe
 Destin'd you might haue beene to such a one
 That would haue lou'd worship't you alone
 One that would suffer hungar, nakedness
 yea deathe ere he would make you numberlesse
 But I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sad decay
 May your ffee>>var:ffew<<=fellowes longer with me staye
 But oh! thou wretched finder whome I hate
 Soe that I allmoste pittie thine Estate
 Gold beinge the heauiest amongst all
 May my moste heauie course vpon the fall
 Here fetter'd, manacled, and ty'd in Chaines
 Firste mayst thou bee, then Chain'd in Hellishe paines
 Or bee with Forraigne Gold brib'd to betraye
 Thy Country and faile bothe of that, and paye
 May the next thing thou stoop'st to reache, c[in>>var:on<<]taine
 Poysone whose nimble f[a>>var:u<<]me rott thy moyste braine
 Or libells, or some interdicted thinge
 w%5c%6h negligently kept thy ruyne bringe
 Lust bred disseasses rott the, and dwell w%5t%6h thee
 Itchie desier and noe abillitie
 May all the hurte w%5c%6h euer Gold hathe wrought
 All mischeefs that all diuells euer thought
 Wante after plentie, poore and Gouty age
 The plagues of Trauellers, Loue, Marriage
 Afflict the, and at thy liues laste moment
 May thy swolne sinnes to the themselus present
 But I foregiue repent the honnest man
 Gold is restoratiue, restore it then
 But if from it thou be'est lothe to departe
 Because t'is Cordiall would t'wer at thy hearte
