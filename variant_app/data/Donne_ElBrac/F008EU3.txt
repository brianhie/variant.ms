Mourne I that I thy seuen-fould chayne haue lost

Thay saue not me, thay do not ease my paines
when in that Hell th'ar burnte, & tyde in chaynes:

for most of them their naturall cuntrey rott
I thinke possesseth, thay cum heere to vs
So pale so lame so leane so ruinous|
& howsoere french kings most-christian be
Their crownes is circumcisde most Iewishly:
Or were thay Spanish stamps still trauayling
That ar becom as Catholique as their kinge,
Those vnlickt beare whelpes, vnfilde Pistoletts
W%5ch%6 more y%5en%6 cannon-shott auayles, or letts, [CW:w%5ch%6#negligently]

Much hope (w%5ch%6 theise should nourish) wilbe dead,
Much of my able youth, & lustyhead

So full (that though he passe them all in sinne)

There wilbe nothing founde, yet be contente,
Receiue from him y%5e%6 doome vngrudgeingly;

Because 't is cordiall, would 'twere at thy harte.|
