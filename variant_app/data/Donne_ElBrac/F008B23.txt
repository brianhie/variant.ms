 Nott that in colour itt was like her hayre
 For Armeletts of that thou maist lett me weare
 Nor that thy hand itt oft imbrac'd, and kist,
 For soe itt had y%5e%6 good, w%5ch%6 of I mist
 Nor for that sillye olde morallitye
 That as those linkes are tyde, our *loues shoulde bee
 Moorne I, that I thy seuen fould chayne haue lost
 Nott for y%5e%6 linkes sake, butt y%5e%6 bitter coste
 Oh shall 12 righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
 Noe leaven of vile souldier did admitt,
 Nor yett by any faulte haue strayde, or gone
 From y%5e%6 first state of theire creation,
 Angells w%5ch%6 heaven com%Manded, to prouide
 All thinges to mee, and bee my faythfull guide
 To gaine newe freinds, to appeare new enemyes, [15v]
 To comfort my soule when I lye, or rise,
 Shall these xii innocents by thy seuere
 Sentence (dread iudge) my sinns greate burthen beare
 Shall they bee damn'd, and in y%5e%6 furnace throwne
 And punnish't for offences nott theire owne,
 They saue nott me, they doe nott ease my paynes
 When in thatt hell, they are burn't, and tyed in chaynes.
 Weare they butt crownes of France I cared nott,
 For most of them, theire naturall cunt>r<y*e rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come here to vs
 Soe leane, soe pale, so lame, so ruinous
 And howsoere French kings most christian bee
 Theire crownes are circumsised most Iewishlye,
 Or weare y%5e%6 Spanish stamps still traveling
 That are become as Catholique as theire king,
 Those vnlick't beare-whelpes, vnfill'd pistoletts
 That more then Cannon shott auailes; or letts,
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vncounted, looke
 Like many angled figures in y%5e%6 booke
 Of some greate coniurer, w%5ch%6 could enforce
 Nature, as these doe iustice from her course,
 W%5ch%6, as y%5e%6 soule quickens, head feete and harte
 As streames like vaynes runne through th'earths euery part
 Visitt all cuntryes, and haue slilye made
 Gorgeous France, ruined, ragged, and decayde,
 Scottland w%5ch%6 k>n<ewe noe state, proude in one daye [16]
 And mangled seaventeene-headed Belgia;
 Oh weare itt such golde, as that there-w%5th%6all
 Allmightye chim%Micks from each minnerall
 Having by suttle fire a soule out pullde
 Are durtely, and desperately gullde:
 I would nott spitt to quench y%5e%6 fire they were in
 For they are guiltye of much haynous sinne
 Butt shall my harmeless Angells perish: shall
 I loose my guarde, my ease, my foode, my all?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they shoulde nourish, will bee dead
 Much of my able youth, and lustihead
 Will vanish; if thou loue lett them alone
 For thou wilt loue me less, when they are gone.
 Oh bee content, that some lowde squi***king cryer
 Well pleasde w%5th%6 one leane thredbare groate for hire,
 May like a Diuell, roare through euerye streete
 And galle y%5e%6 finders conscience, if they meete,
 Oh, lett me creepe to some dreade coniurer,
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 Phantastique shreames, fullfills much penurye,
 W%5ch%6 hath diuided heaven into tenements
 And w%5th%6 whores, theues, and murtherers, stuff her rents
 Soe full, that though he pass them all in sinne
 He leaues himselfe noe roome to enter in.
 And if when all his art and time is spent
 He sayes twill nere be founde, oh be content
 Receiue from him y%5e%6 doome vngrudginglye
 Because he is the mouth of destinye.
 Thou sayst alass y%5e%6 golde doth still remayne [16v]
 Though itt bee chang'd, and put into a chayne
 Soe in y%5e%6 first falne Angells resteth still
 Wisdome and knowledge, butt tis turnd to ill
 As these shoulde doe good workes and shoulde p>r<ovide
 Necessityes; but now must nurse thy pride
 And they are still bad Angells, myne are none
 For forme giues beeing, and theire forme is gone;
 Pittye these Angells yett, theire dignityes
 Pass vertues, powers and principallityes;
 But thou ar resolute; thy will be done
 Yet w%5th%6 such anguish, as her only sonne
 The mother in her hungrye graue doth lay;
 Vnto y%5e%6 fire these Martirs I betraye
 Good soules, for you giue life to euerye thinge
 Good Angells, for good messages you bringe,
 Destined, you might haue beene, to such a one
 As would haue lou'd and worship't you alone
 One who woulde suffer hunger, nakedness
 Yea death, ere he would make you numberlesse,
 But I am guiltye of your sadd decaye
 May your few fellowes longer w%5th%6 me staye;
 But oh, thou wretched finder, whome I hate
 So much, that I allmost pittye thy estate
 Golde, beeing the heaviest mettall amongst all
 May my most-heavy curse vppon thee fall:|
