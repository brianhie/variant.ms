Not that in Coullo%5r%6. it was like thy hayre;
ffor Armeletts of that thou ma%Ayst let mee weare;
Nor that thy hand it ofte embrac'd and kyste,
ffor soe it had that good, w.%5ch%6 ofte I miste.
Nor for that seely old moralitee
That as those Linckes are tyed, our loue should bee,
Mourne I; that I thy seaven-fold Chayne haue lost,
Nor for the lucks sake*, but the bitter cost.
O%Ch shall twelue righteous Angells w%5ch%6 as yet
Noe leauen of vylde soder did admitt,
Nor yet by any tainte haue strayde or go%Mne
ffrom the first state of their Creation. 
Angells w%5ch%6 heauen com%Maunded to prouyde 
All thinges to mee, and bee my faithfull %Ygy%Z guyde,
To gaine newe ffrendes, to'appease greate enemyes,
To comfort my Soule when I lye, or ryse.
Shall these twelue Innocentes by thy seueare
Sentence, (dread Iudge) my syns greate burden beare?
Shall they bee dam%M'd, and in the fournace throwne 
And punish't for offences not their owne?
They saue not mee, they doo not ease my paynes, 
when in that hell they' b*->>are, burn'd, and tyed in Chaynes. 
weare they but Crownes of ffraunce I cared not, 
ffor most of them their naturall Country rott
I thincke possesseth, they come heere to vs [f. 41r]
Soe leane, soe pale, soe lame, soe ruin*ous; >>f.<< 
And howsoere ffrench kinges most Christian bee
Their Crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishlee.
Or weare they Spanishe stampes, still traueling,
That are become as Catholike as their kinge, 
Those vnlick'd beare=whelpes, vnfyl'd pistoletts
That more then Canon shotts avayles or lets,
w%5ch%6 negligently lefte vnrounded, looke
Like many angel'd ffigures, in the booke
Of some greate Coniurer, w%5ch%6 would enforce 
Nature, as these doe Iustiyce from hir Course.
w%5ch%6, as the Soule quickens head, ffeete, and harte,
As streames like veynes runne th*rowe the 'earthes eu'ery parte 
visitt all Countryes, and haue slilye made
Gorgeous ffraunce ragged; ruin'd and decayde
Scotland w%5ch56 knewe noe state, proude in one day;
And mangled seaventeene headed %1Belgia%2. 
Or weare it such gold as that wheare w%5th%6 all 
Almighty %1Chimicks%2 from each minerall
Having by subtile ffyre a Soule out-pull'd
Are durtely and desperately gull'd;
I would not spitt to quenche the ffyre they 'weare in,
ffo%5r%6. they are guilty of much heynous syn. 
But shall my harmelesse Angells perishe? shall
I loose my guarde, my ease, my ffoode, my All?
Much hope w.%5ch%6 they should nourishe wilbe dead, [f. 41v]
much of my able youthe, and lustyhead
will vanishe, if thou loue let them alone,
ffor thou wilt loue mee lesse when they are gon%Me. 
O%C bee content that some loude squeaking Cryer
well pleas'd w%5th%6 one leane threadbare groate for hyre,
May like a Devill roare throughe euery streete
And gall the fynders Conscience if they meete.
Or let mee Creepe to some dread Coniurer
w.%5ch%6 w.%5th%6 fantastique scheames fullfills much paper,
w%5ch%6 hath deuided heauen in Tenements
And w%5th%6 whores theeues and murtherers stufft his rents
Soe full, that thoughe* hee passe them all in syn, 
Hee leaues himselfe noe roome to enter in; 
And if when all his arte and tyme is spent
Hee say t'will ne're bee found, O%C bee content,
Receiue the doome from him vngrudginlye,
Because hee is the Mouthe of Destinye.
Thou say'st, alas the gold doth still remayne
Thoughe it bee chaung'd and put into a Chayne, 
Soe in those first falne Angells resteth still
wisdome and knowledge, but 'tis turn'd to ill. 
As these should doe good workes, and should prouyde
Necessityes, but nowe must nource thy pryde.
And they are still badd Angells, myne are none, [f. 42r]
ffor fforme giues being, and their fforme is go%Mne. 
Pitye these Angells yet, their Dignityes
Passe virtues, powers and principallityes.
But thou art resolute, thy will bee don%Me 
Yet w%5th%6. such anguishe as hir only sonne 
The Mother in the hungry graue doth lay, 
vnto the ffyre these Martyrs I betray.
Good Soules for you giue lyfe to euery thinge
Good Angells for good messages You bringe;
Destin'd you mighte haue bin to such a one 
As would haue lou'd, and worship'd you alone.
One w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger, Nakednesse,
Yea Deathe, e're hee would make yo%5r%6. nomber lesse.
But I am guilty of yo%5r%6. sadd decay 
May yo%6%5r. fewe fellowes longer w.%5th%6 mee stay. 
But O%C thou wretched fynder whome I hate
Soe much, as I almost pittye thy state, 
Gold being the heauyest mettle amongst all
May my most heavy Curse vppon thee fall.
Heere fettre'd, manicled, and hang'd in Chaynes
ffirst mayst thou bee, then chayn'd to hellishe paynes,
Or bee w.%5th%6 forraine gold bryb'd to betray
Thy Country, and fayle both of that and thy pray.
May the next thinge thou stoop'st to reache, contayne
Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moist brayne
Or Libells, or some interdicted thinge [f. 42v]
w%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bringe.
Lust breed Diseases rott thee, and dwell w%5th%6 thee
Itchy Desire, and noe abilitee.
May all the hurte w%5ch%6 euer gold hath wroughte,
All mischeifes w%5ch%6 all Devills euer thoughte,
wante after plenty, poore and gowty Age,
The plagues of Trauellers, loue, and Maryage
Afflict thee, and at thy lyfes latest moment 
May thy swolne synnes themselues to thee present.
But I forgiue; repent then honest Man
Gold is restoratiue, restore it than, 
Or if w%5th%6 it thou beest lothe to departe,
Because 'tis Cordiall, w'ould 'tweare at thy harte.|
