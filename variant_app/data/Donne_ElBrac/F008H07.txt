 Nor for that sillie old mora%Allity [80r.]
 That as those Links a%Are tyde, o%5r%6 Love shold bee
 Mourne I that the[var:>>thy<<] seaven-fowld Chayne ha%Aue lost
 Not for thy[var:>>the<<] Luc%Ake sake but the bytter Cost.
 Oh! Shall twelue righteous Angels, w%5ch%6 a%As yet
 Noe Leaven of vile Soder did Admitt 
 Nor yet by any fa%Ault ha%Aue straid or gone
 from the first sta%Ate of their Creatyon.
 Angels w%5ch%6 heavens Coma%Mded to provide
 All things to mee, and be my faithfull Guyde.
 To Gayne new frends, To appease great Enimyes 
 To Comfort my sowle, when I ly or rise;
 Shall these twelue Inocents by thy severe
 Sentence (Great Iudge) my syns great burthen \(bear
 Shall they be damn'd, and in thye furna%Ace throwne,
 And pun%Misht for Ofence%As not their o%Awne?
 They saue not me, they doe not ease my Paines
 When in that Hell, they are burnt, & ty'de in Chaines
 Were they but Crownes of ffrance%A, I cared not,
 ffor most of them thei*%5r%6 Na%Atura%Al Cuntry rott;
 I think possetheth: They co%Ame here to vs [CW:.Soe.]
 So leane, so Pale, so Lame and Ruyonous; [80v.]
 And howsoer'e frenc%Ah Kings most Christians bee
 There Crownes are Circu%Mcise'd most %1Iewishly%2.
 Or were they, Spanish stamps still trava%Ailinge
 That a%Are beco%Ame as Catholique as their kinge:
 Those vn-lic%Akt Bear-whelps, vnfyld Pistolets
 That more then Comon[var:>>cannon<<] shots avayles, or letts,
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded looke
 Like many Angled fygures in y%5e%6 Booke,
 Of some great Coniure%5r%6, w%5ch%6 wold enforc%Ae
 Nature (as thay do Iustic%Ae) from her Course.
 W%5c%Ah%6 as the Sowle quickens head, foot, & hart
 As stream-like vaines run through th'earths eu%5r%6y p%Pt.
 Visit all Cou%Mtryes, and haue slylie mad'e%A
 Gorgeous France ragged, ruynd, & dec%Aayd.
 Scotland w%5c%Ah%6 knew noe state, prowd in one da%Ay
 And ma%Angled seventene-headed Belgia.
 Or were it such Gold, as that, wherw%5t%6hall
 Almightye Chymicks from each Mynerall,
 Ha%Aving by suble fyre a%A Sowle out puld [CW:.Are.]
 Are dirtely, and desperately Guld. [81r.]
 I wold not spit to quen%Ach the fyre they a%Are in 
 ffor they a%Are guylty, of much haynous Sin
 But shall my harmles Angels p%Pish? Sha%All
 I loose my Guard, my Ease, my food and all?
 Muc%Ah hope w%5c%Ah%6 they shold nurish wilbe dead
 Muc%Ah of my able yow%5th%6, and livelie-head
 will vanish; If thou Loue me let them a%Alone
 ffor thou wilt Loue me lesse, when they ar gone. 
 Oh! be Content y%5t%6 some Lowd Squeakinge Crye%5r%6
 Well pleasd w%5th%6 one lea%Ane-threed-bare Grot for hyer
 May like A Divill roare through eu%5r%6y street
 And ga%All the Fynders Conscience if they meet. 
 Or let me Creepe to some d>>%Vr<<ead Coniure%5r%6
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastique Sheaues fills full much pa%Ap%P
 W%5ch%6 haue devided Heaven in Tenem%5ts%6

 And if when all his Art, and time is spent [81v]
 He say 'twill nere be found: oh be Content
 Rec%Aeive the Doome from him vngrudgeingly
 Because he is the mouth of destinye.
 Thou saist alas! the Gold doth still rema%Aine
 Though it be Chaung'd & put into a Chayne:
 Soe in the first falne Angels resteth still
 Wisdom, and Knowledg; but tis turnd to yll.
 As these shold doe good works, and shold p%Pvide
 Nec%Aesseties, but now must Nurse their[var:>>thy<<] Pryd;
 And they ar still Badd Angels myne; are none
 ffor forme gives beeing, and their forme is gone
 Pitty these Angels, yet their Dygnities

 But thou art resolute thy will bee done,
 Yet w%5th%6 such Anguish, As her only sonne
 The mothe%5r%6 in the Hungry Graue Doth la%Ay
 Vnto the fyre these Marters, I betray.
 Good Sowles, for yo%5w%6 give life to eu%5r%6y thinge [CW:.Good.]
 Good Angels, for yo%5w%6 good Messages do bringe, [82r]
 Destind yo%5w%6 might ha%Aue bene to suc%Ah a%An one

 Yea death, ere hee would make yo%5r%6 nu%Mber lesse
 But I a%Am Guyltie of yo%5r%6 sad deca%Ay

 But oh thou wretc%Ahed Fynder! whom I hate
