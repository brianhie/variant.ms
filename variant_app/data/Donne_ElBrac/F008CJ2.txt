Not that in Collour it is like thye hayre:
for armelets of that, thou mayst let me weare;
nor that thy hande it oft imbrac'd & kist,
for soe it had the good, w%5ch%6 ofte I mist,
nor for that selly ould Morallytie,
that as those linckes are tied our loues should bee
mourne I, that I, thy seauen fould Chayne haue lost:
nor for the luckes sake, but the bitter cost,
oh shall twelue righteous Angells w%5ch%6 as yet;
noe levin of vile sodar, did admitt,
nor yet by any taynte haue stray'd or gone,
from the first state of their Creation,
Angells which heauen Commaunded to prouid
all things to me, & be my faythfull guide;
to gaine neare frends, t'appease great enymies,
to Comforte my sowle, when I lye or ryse.|.
shall these twelue inocents by thy seveare,
sentence (dread Judge) my sinnes great burden beare,
shall they bee damn'd in the furnace throwne;
and punisht, for offences not their owne;
they saue not me they dooe not ease my paynes,
When in that hell the'ar burnt & tyed in Chaynes,
were they but Crownes of ffrance I Cared not,
for most of them, ther natiue Cuntry rott;
I thincke possible they come hear to vs,
so leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinovs,
and how soere ffrench Kings, most christian bee;
their Crownes are circumsisd most Jewishlye;
or wear they Spanish stampes, still travellinge,
that wer become as Catholike as their Kinge;
those vnlickt beare whelpes, vnfild pistolets,
that more then Cannon shott auayles or letts;
which negligently >lefte vnrownded looke;
like many Angled figues in y%5e%6 booke;
of some greate Conivror, w%5ch%6 would inforce:
nature as these doe Justice from her Course;
w%5ch%6 as the sowle quickenes, heade feete & harte;
as streames like vaines rune through y%5e%6 earth's each parte;
vnfitt all cuntries, and haue sleylie made,
gorgious Fraunce ragged, ruyned and decay;
Scotland y%5t%6 knew noe state, proued in one day;
A mangled seaventenn headed Belgia.x.|.
or were it such gould as y%5t%6 wher with all;
all mightye Chimickes from each minerall;
hauinge by subtill fire a soule out pulld,
are durtelye and desperatlye guld;
I would not spitt to quench the fyre the'are in;
for they are guiltye of mutch heynous sinne;
but shall my harmelesse Angelles perish all;
I loose my guard, my foode, my ease, my all;
much hoope w%5ch%6 they should norish will bee deade;
much of my able youth, and lustye head;
Would perish then, loue me let them aloone;
for thou wilte loue me lesse, when they are gone;
oh bee Contente that some lowde squeakinge cryer;
well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane thridbare groate for hire;
May like a Devill roare through every streete;
and gall the finders, Conscience if they meete;
or let me Crepe to some dread Coniuror;
w%5ch%6 with fantastick sceanes fills full much paper,
Who haue diuided heauen in tenement's;
And w%5th%6 whores, theeues, and Murtherers stuff his rentes;
soe full that though hee passe them all in sinne,
he leaues him selfe noe roome to enter in;
and if when all his arte and tyme is spente;
hee sayes t'will nere bee founde, oh bee contente.|.
Receiue the doome from him vngrudginglye;
because he is the mouth of destenye:
thou sayest alase the gould doth still remayne;
though it bee Chang'd and put into a Chayne;
soe in those first fallinge Angells resteth still;
wisdome and knowledge, but t'is turnd to ill;
as these should bee good workes & should provid.
Necessities, but now must nurse thy pride,
and they are still bad Angells myne are none,
for forme giues beeinge & thir forme is goone,
pittye these Angells yet their dignityes,
passe virtues powers and Principallities;
but thou art resolute thy will bee doone,
Yet with such anguish as hir onely sonne,
the Mother in the hungrey graue doth laye,
and to the fire theis martirs I betraye;
good soules for you giue life to every thinge,
good Angells, for good messages you bringe,
Destin'd might you haue ben to such a one,
that would haue lou'd, and worshipt you a lone;
one would haue suffred hunger nakednesse,
nay death ere hee would make you nomberlesse;
but I ame guilty of your sad decaye,
May your fayer fellowes longer w%5th%6 me staye.|.
But oh thou wreched finder, whom I hate;
soe much y%5t%6 I allmost pittye thy estate;
gould beinge y%5e%6 heaviest mettell amoungst all,
may my most heauye Curse vppon the fall;
here fettred manacld and hang'd in chaynes:
first mayest thou be, then chayn'd to hellish paynes,
or be with forren gould bribd to betraye,
thy Cuntry & fayle both of that and thy praye,
May the next thinge thou stoop'st to reach contayne,
poyson whose nimble fume rotte thy moyst braine;
or libells for some interdicted thinge,
Which negligently kepte thy ruine bringe;
lust bread diseases rott the and dwell w%5th%6 the,
itchinge desire and noe abillitye;
may all the hurte y%5t%6 ever gould hath wrought,
all mischeife w%5ch%6 all devills euer thought,
wante after plenty, poore and gowtey age,
the plagues of trauellers loue and Mariage;
afflicte the and at thy liues latest monmente;
may thie swolne sines them selues to the p%Psent;
but I forgiue repente thou honest man;
gould is restoratiue, restore it then,
or if w%5th%6 it thou best loath to departe;
because ti's Cordiall, would t'wer at thy harte.|.
