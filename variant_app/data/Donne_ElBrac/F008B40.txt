 Not that in Couller it was like thie Hayre,
 for Armletts of that, thou mayst lett mee were;
 Nor that thie hand it ofte ymbrac'd and kiste,
 for soe, it had that good, w%5ch%6 ofte I miste.
 Nor for that Seelly old Moralitie
 that as those Linkes were tied, our loue should be,
 %1Mourne%2 I. that I thie seaven fould chayne haue lost,
 nor for the lucke sake, but the bigger cost.
 Oh, shall twelue righteous %1Angells,%2 w%5ch%6 as yett
 noe leaven of vile %1Soder%2, did admitt;
 Nor yett by any fault, have straid and gon
 from the first state of their %1Creation%2,
 %1Angells%2 w%5ch%6 heaven comaunded to provide
 all things to me, and be my faithfull guide
 to gaine new frendes, to appease great enemies,
 to comforte my soule when I lye or rise;
 shall these twelue %1Innocents%2, by thie seuere
 sentence, dred %1Iudg%2, my sinnes great burthen beare?
 shall they be damn'd and in the furnace throwne
 and punish'd for offences not their owne,
 they Save not me, they do not ease my paines,
 when in that %1Hell%2 they are bur%Mte and tied in chaines,
 were they but %1Crownes%2 of ffrance, I car'd not,
 for most of them their naturall country rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come heare to vs
 so leane, so pale, so lame, so Ruinous, [CW:om]
 And how soere %1French Kings%2 most %1Christian%2 bee, [66v]
 their %1Crownes%2 are circumsic'd most %1Iewishly%2,
 Or were they %1Spanish%2 stampes, still traveyling,
 that are become as %1Catholique%2 as their %1Kinge%2,
 those vnlick'd %1Bearwhelps%2, vnfil'd pistoletts,
 that More then %1Cannon%2 shott, aveyles or letts,
 W%5ch%6 negligentlie lefte vnrounded, looke
 like Many=%1Angled%2 figures in the booke
 of some great %1Coniurer%2, w%5ch%6 would enforce
 nature, as these do Iustice from her course;
 w%5ch%6, as the soule quickens head, feet, and hart,
 as stremes like vaynes, run through th'earthes euery part
 Visitt all countries, and haue slily made
 %1Gorgeus France%2 ruin'd, ragged and decay'd,
 %1Scottland%2 w%5ch%6 knew noe state proude in one daie,
 and Mangled seaventeen headed %1Belgia%2.
 Or were it such %1Gold%2 as that wher w%5th%6 all
 allmightie %1Chemicks%2 from ech %1Minerall%2
 having by subtile fier a soule out pull'd,
 are durtelye and desperatelie gull'd,
 I would not spett to quench the fier they were in,
 for they are guiltie of much haynous sin,
 but shall my harmelesse %1Angells%2 perrish? shall
 I loose my Guarde, my ease, my foode, my all?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should Nourish wilbe dead,
 Much of my able yough and %1Lustihead%2
 will vanish, if thou Loue lett them alone,
 for thou wilt loue me lesse, when they are gon:
 Oh (be content) that some low'd squeaking cryer
 well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane=thred bare groat for hier,
 maye like a divell rore through euery street,
 and %Yg****e%Z>%Vgate< the finders %1Concience%2 if he meet;
 or lett me creepe to some dred %1Coniurer%2
 w%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastique Sceames, fills full much paper,
 w%5ch%6 haue devided %1Heauen%2 in Tenements
 and w%5th%6 whores, Theues, & murtherers stuff'd his rents [CW:/so#full]
 soe full, that thoughe he passe them all in sinn, [67]
 he leaues himself noe rome to enter in,
 and if, when all his art and time is spent,
 he saye twill near be found, (oh be content
 receyue from him the doome vngrudgingly
 because his is the mouth of desteny,
 Thou saiest alasse, the gould doth still remayne
 though it be chang'd, and put into a chaine.
 So in the first falne %1Angells%2, resteth still
 Wisdome and knowledg, but t'is turnd to ill:
 as these should doe good workes and should provide
 necessities, but now must nurse thy pride,
 and they >%Vare< still badd angells, myne are none,
 for forme gives being, and their forme is gon;
 Pitty these %1Angells%2 yett, their dignities
 passe virtues, powers, and principalities,
 but thou arte resolute, thie wilbee don,
 yett w%5th%6 such anguish, as her only sonn
 the mother in the hungrie %1Graue%2 doth laye,
 vnto the ffier, these Marters I betraye,
 good soules, for you giue life to euery thing,
 good %1Angells%2 for good Messages yo%5u%6 bring,
 Destyn'd yo%5u%6 might have byn to such a one,
 as would have lov'd and worship't you alone,
 one w%5ch%6 would Suffer %1Hunger, Nakednes%2,
 yea %1Death%2 ere he would make yo%5r%6 number lesse;
 but I am giultie of yo%5r%6 Sadd decay,
 maye yo%5r%6 >%Vfew< fellowes w%5th%6 me longer stay,
 but oh thou wretched finder whom I hate
 so much, that I almost pitty thie estate,
 Gold being the %1Heuiest%2 mettall amongst all,
 may my most heavye cursse vppon thee fall,
 Hear fettred, Manacled, and hang'd in chaines
 first mayst thou be, then chayn'd to %1Hellish%2 paynes,
 or be w%5th%6 forreyn %1Gold%2, brib'd to betray
 thie country, and faile both of that and thie paye, [CW:om]
 May the next thing thou stoopest to reach, conteyne [67v]
 poyson, whose nimble fume, rott thie moyst brayne,
 or %1Libells%2, or some %1Interdicted%2 thing
 w%5ch%6 negligentlie kept, thie %1Ruine%2 bring,
 %1Lust,%2 breed %1Deseases%2, rott thee, and dwell w%5th%6 thee
 %1Itchy%2 desier, and noe %1Abiletye%2,
 may all the hurt that euer Gold hath wrought,
 all Mischifes w%5ch%6 all %1Diuells%2 euer thought,
 want after plenty, poore and Gouty age,
 the plaugues of %1Traueilers%2, Loue, and Marriage
 afflict thee; and at thie Liues latest moment
 may thie swolne sinnes themselues to thee present;
 But I forgiue, repent thou honest mann,
 gould is restorative, restore it then,
 or if w%5th%6 it thou beest loth to depart,
 because t'is %1Cordiall%2 would t'were at thie %1Hart%2|
