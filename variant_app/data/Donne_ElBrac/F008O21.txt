 Not that in Colour it was like thy haire
 for armelettes of that thou mayst lett me weare
 nor that thy hand it oft embrac't and kis't
 for so I had y%5t%6 good that oft I mist,
 nor for that silly old mortalitye
 y%5t%6 as these lynckes are tide o%5r%6 loues should bee
 mourne I y%5t%6 I thy seauen fold chaine haue lost
 nor for the luckes sake but the bitter Cost
 oh shall twelue righteous angells w%5ch%6 as yett
 not leauen of vild soder did admitt.
 nor yett by any fault haue strayd or gone [CW:om]
 ffrom the first state of their creation, [210]
 Angells w%5ch%6 heauen commaunded to p%Puide
 all thinges to mee, & bee my faythfull guide
 To gaine new frindse; to appease great enemyes
 To Comfort my soule when I ly or rise
 shall these twelue inocentes, by thy seuere
 Sentence dread Iudge; my sins great burthen beare
 Shall they bee damn'd & in the, ffornace throwne
 & punish't for offences not their owne,
 They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paines,
 When in y%5t%6 Hell they are burn't & tide in chaines
 Were they but Crownes of ffrance I cared not
 ffor most of these; their Countryes naturall rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come heere to vs
 so pale, so lame, so leane; so ruinous;
 & howsoere ffrench Kinges most Christian bee
 their crownes, are Circumcis'd most Iewishly
 or>%Ye%Z< were they Spanish stampes still trauelinge
 that are become as Catholique as their kinge
 these vnlickt beare whelpes, vnfil'd pistolettes
 y%5t%6 more then Canno%M shott avayles or lettes
 or negligently left vnrounded looke
 like any angled figures in the booke
 of some great Coniurer that would enforce
 nature as those doe Iustice, from her Course; [CW:om]
 w%5ch%6 as the soule runs through the head feet hart. [211]
 as streames; like veines, runn; through the earths eu%5r%6y p%Pt
 visitt all Countiyes and haue slyly made
 Gorgeous ffrance ruin'd raged, and decayd;
 Scottland w%5ch%6 knew no state proude in one day
 & mingled seauenteene headded Belgia,
 or were it such gold as that where w%5th%6all.
 allmight Chymistes from Each minerall
 haueing butt->>by< subtile fire a soule out puld
 are durtely and desperately gul'd
 I would not spitt to quench the fire ther in,
 for they are guilty of much hainous sinne.
 But shall my harmelesse Angells perish? shalt
 I loose my Gard; my ease; my food my all;
 much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish wilbee dead
 much of my able youth and lusty head
 Will vanish if thou loue lett them alone
 for thou wilt loue mee lesse w%M they are gone
 & be Content y%5t%6 some loawd squeaking Cryer  
 (wel pleas'd w%5th%6 one bare thread bare groat for hyer)
 may like a Deuill rore through Euery streete
 & gall the finders Conscience if he meete
 or lett mee Creepe to some dread Coniurer
 y%5t%6 w%5th%6 phantastick scenes fills vp much paper
 w%5ch%6 hath deuided heauen in tenem%5ts%6
 & w%5th%6 whores; theeues & murtherers shiftes his rentes, [CW:om]
 so full y%5t%6 (though he passe them all in sinne) [212]
 he leaues himselfe %Yto#enter%Z no roome to enter in,
 but if when all his arte and time is spent
 he say 'twill neuer befound; yet be content
 receaue from him that doome vngrudgingly
 because he is the mouth of destinye
 Thou sayst alas the gold doth still remayne
 though it be chang'd and putt into a chaine
 so in the first falne angels resteth still
 Wisdome, & knowledge but 'tis turn'd to ill
 as these should doe good workes, & should p%Puide
 necessityes; but now must nurse the pride
 And they are still bad angells; mine ar none
 for forme giues being; and their forme is gonne
 Pitty these Angells; yet their dignityes;
 passe Vertues; powers: and principallityes
 but thou%Ygh%Z ar resolut; thy wilbe done
 yet w%5th%6 such anguish; and her onely sonne,
 the mother in the hungry graue doth lay
 vnto the fire these Martyrs I betray
 good soules for you giue light to euery thinge
 good angells for good messuages y%5u%6 bringe
 Destined you might haue beene to such a one
 y%5t%6 would haue lou'd and worship't you alone, [CW:om]
 One that would suffer hunger nakednesse [213]
 yea death ere he would make y%5r%6 number lesse
 but I am guilty of my->>y%5r%6< sad decay
 May but y%5r%6 few fellowes, longer w%5th%6 mee stay
 But oh thou wretched finder whome I hate
 so that I almost pitty thy estate
 gold being the heauiest mettall amongst all
 May my must heauy Curse vppo%M thee fall
 heere fetter'd; Manacled; and hang'd in chaines
 first mayst thou bee y%M chaind to hellish paines
 or bee w%5th%6 fooraine gold brib'd to betray
 Thy Country and fayle, both of y%5t%6 & thy pay &c [CW:om]
 May the next thing tho stoopest, to reach containe [44]
 poyson whose nimble fume may rott thy braine


 Lust breed deseases rot thee; & dwell with thee 
 Itching desire and not ability 
 May all the euills that gold euer wrough 
 all mischiefes that all deuills euer thought; 
 Want after plenty; poore and gouty age 
 the plague of all trauellours; loue; mariage 
 afflict thee and at thy liues latest moment 
 may thy swolne sinns; themselues to thee p%Psent 
 But I forgiue; repent thee honest man 
 gold is restoratiue; restore it than 
 but if from it thou beest loath to depart 
 because tis cordiall; would 'twere at thy heart 
 ffinis
