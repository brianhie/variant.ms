 Not y%5t%6 in couller yt was lyke thy hayre,
 For Armeletts of That, thou mayst let me weare,
 Nor y%5t%6 this hand, yt oft embrac'd and kist,
 For soe yt had that good w%5ch%6 oft I Mist;
 Nor for y%5t%6 seelye olld Moralitye,
 That as those lincks are tyed, our loue shoulld be,
 Mourne I, y%5t%6 I this Seaven folde chayne haue lost,
 Nor for the lucke sake, but y%5e%6 bitter Cost;
 Oh shall xii righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yett
 Noe leaven of vile sodder did admitt,
 Nor yett by any fault haue strayde and gone
 From the first state of theyre Creation;
 Angells w%5ch%6 Heaven commannded to provide
 All things to mee, and be my Faythfull Guide,
 To gaine new Friends, to appease greate Enemyes,
 To comfort my Soule, when I lye, or rise,
 Shall these xii Innocents, by thy severe
 Sentence (Dreade Iudge) my sins greate burthen beare,
 Shall they be damn'd, and in the Furnace throwne,
 And punnish'd for offences not theyre owne?
 They saue not Mee; They doe not ease my paynes,
 When yn that hell, they are burnt, & tyed in Chaynes;
 Were they but Crownes of Fraunce, I car'd not,
 For most of them, theyre Naturall Country rott,
 I thinke possesseth, They come here to vs,
 So leane, so payle, soe lame, soe Ruinous.
 And howsoe're French Kings most Christian be
 Theyre Crownes are Circumcis'd most Iewishlye
 Or weare they Spannish Stamps, still travailinge,
 That are become as Catholique as theyre Kinge. [CW:(Those.]
 Those vnlick'd Beare whelpes, vnfil'd Pistoletts, [24r]
 That more then Cannon shott, Avayles, or letts,
 W%5ch%6 necligentlye left vnrounded, looke
 Lyke many angled ffigures in the booke
 Of some greate Coniurer, w%5ch%6 woulld enforce
 Nature; As these doe Iustice from her Course.
 W%5ch%6 as y%5e%6 Soule quickens heade, feete, and hart,
 As Streames, lyke veynes runs through the earths every part.
 Visitt all Countryes, and haue slylye made
 Gorgeus France ruin'd, ragged, and decayde;
 Scotland w%5ch%6 knewe noe State, Proude in One day,
 And mangled Seaven-teene headed Belgia.
 Or were yt such gold, as y%5t%6 where w%5th%6 all
 Allmightye Chemycks from each Mynerall.
 Haveinge by subtile fyre a Soule out pull'd.
 Are durtylye, and desperatelye Gull'd.
 I woulld not spitt to quench y%5e%6 fyre they were in.
 For they are guiltye of much heynous Syn.
 But shall my harmeles Angells perish?  Shall
 I loose my Guard, my ease, my Foode, my All?
 Much hope, w%5ch%6 they shoulld nourish, will be dead
 Much of my able Youth, and Lustyheade.
 Will vanish; yf thou loue, lett them alone,
 For thou wilt loue lesse, when they are gone.
 Oh be Content, That some loude squeakinge Cryer,
 Well pleas'd w%5th%6 one leane thred-bare groate for hyre,
 May lyke a Devill rore thorough every Streete,
 And gall y%5e%6 finders Conscience, yf they meete.
 Or lett me Creepe to some Dreade Coniurer
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 Fantastique Scheames fullfills much paper.
 W%5ch%6 hath devided Heaven in Tenements,
 And w%5th%6 whores, Theeves, & Murtherers stuft his Rents,
 Soe full, y%5t%6 though he passe them all in Synne
 He leaves him selfe no roome to enter in.
 And yf when all his Art and tyme, is Spent,
 He say, t'will neere be found, oh be Content.
 Receave from him y%5e%6 doome vngrudginglye
 Because he is y%5e%6 Mouth of Destinye. [CW:(Thou#says't.]
 Thou sayst, Alas y%5e%6 golld doth still remaine,  [24v]
 Though yt be chang'd, and put in to a Chayne.
 Soe in the first, fall'n Angells resteth Still,
 Wisdome and Knowledge, but t'is turn'd to Ill,
 As these shoulld doe good workes, and shoulld provide
 Necessityes, but now must nurse thy Pryde.
 And they are still bad Angells, Myne are None,
 For forme giues Beeinge, & theyre forme is gone
 Pyttye these Angells, yett theyre dignityes
 Passe vertues, Powers, and Principalytyes;
 But thou art resolute;  Thy will be done.
 Yett with such Anguish, As her onelye Sonne,
 The Mother in y%5e%6 hungrye Grave doth lay,
 Vnto the Fyre these Martyres I betray.
 Good Soules, for you giue Lyfe to every thinge
 Good Angells, for good Messages you bringe.
 Destin'd you might haue beene to such a One,
 As would haue lov'd, and worshipt you alone;
 One w%5ch%6 woulld suffer hungar, nakednes,
 Yea Death, ere he woulld make yo%5r%6 number lesse
 But I am Guiltye of your sad decaye
 May your Few Fellowes longer w%5th%6 mee stay.
 But oh, Thou wretched Finder, whome I hate
 Soe much, That I pyttye thy State;
 Golld beinge the heaviest Mettall amongst All
 May my most heavy Curse vppon y%5e%6 Fall.
 Here fetter'd, man%Macled, and hang'd in Chaynes,
 First mayst thou bee, then chain'd in Hellish paynes.
 Or be w%5th%6 forraigne gould, brib'd to betraye
 Thy Countrye, and fayle both of y%5t%6, and thy Pay.
 May the next thinge, thou stoop'st to reach conteyne,
 Poyson, whose nimble Fume, rott thy Moyst Brayne.
 Or lybells, or some Interdicted Thinge
 W%5ch%6 negligentlye kept, Thy Ruine bringe.
 Lust-bred Diseases Rott Thee, And dwell w%5th%6 Thee,
 Itchy Desyre, And noe Abilytye.
 May all the hurt, w%5ch%6 ever Goulld hath wrought
 All Mischiefes, w%5ch%6 all Devills ever thought.
 Want after plentye, poore, & gouty Age,
 The plagues of Travillers, Loue, and Maryadge [CW:(Afflict]
 Afflict Thee, And at thy lyfes latest Moment, [25r]
 May thy swolne Sins them selves to the present,
 But I forgiue.  Repent Thou honest Man,
 Gold is Restorative, Restore yt then.
 Or yf w%5th%6 yt, Thou beest loath to depart,
 Because t'is Cordiall, would t'were at thy Hart.|
