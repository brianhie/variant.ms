N%+ot that in colour it was like thy haire,
ffor Armeletts of that, thou ma'yst lett mee weare;
Nor that thy hand is->>it< oft embrac't, and kist:
ffor soe it had the good, w%5ch%6 oft I mist.
Nor for the seelie old moralitie,
That as those linckes are tyed, o%5r%6 loves should bee.
Mourne I, that thy sevenfold Chaine haue lost;
Nor for the lucke sake, but the bitter Cost.
Oh! shall twelve righteous Angelles, w%5ch%6 as yet
No leuen of vild Solder did admitt;
Nor yet by anie fault haue strayde, or gone
ffrom the first state of their creation.
Angelles, w%5ch%6 Heav'ne comaunded to provide
All thinges to mee, and bee my faithfull Guide,
To gaine new freindse, to appease great Enemies,
To comfort my Soule when I lie, or rise.
Shall these twelue Innocents by the->>thy< severe
Sentence (dread Iudge) my Sins great burthen beare?
Shall they bee dam'nd,? and in the furnace throwne?
And punished for offences not theire owne?
They save not mee, they doe not ease my paines,
When in that Hell they are burnt, and tyed in Chaines.
Weare they but Crownes of ffraunce I cared not, [CW: ffor]
ffor most of them, their naturall Countrie rott [f. 21v
I think possesseth, they come heere to Vs
Soe leane, soe pale, soe lame, so ruinous.
And howsoere French-Kinges most christian bee
Their Crownes are circumsi'zd most Iewishlie.
Or were they Spanishe-stampes, still travayling
That are become as catholique, as their King.
Those vnlick't Beare-whelpes, vnfil'd Pistolets
That more then Cannon-shott avayles, or lettes.
W%5ch%6 negligentlie left vn-rounded, looke
Lyke manie angled figures in the Booke
Of some great Coniurer, w%5ch%6 would enforce
Nature, as these doe Iustice from her Course.
Which as the Soule quickens head, foote, and hart
As streames, like vaines runnes through th'Earths euery-\(part
Visitt all Countries, and haue slilie made
Gorgeous france ruind, ragged, and decaide.
Scotland, w%5ch%6 knewe noe State, prowde in one daye
And mangled seuenteene-headded Belgia.
Or were it such Gold as that, wherwithall
Almightie Chimickes from each Minerall
Having by subtle fire a Soule out-puld
Are durtelie, and desperatelie guld.
I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in,
ffor they are guiltie of much haynous Sinn. [CW: But]
But shall my harmelesse Angells perishe? Shall [f. 22r
I loose my Guard, my life, my food, my All?
Much hope, w%5ch%6 they should nourishe will bee dead
Much of my able youth, and Lustiehead
Will b>%>v<anishe: If thou love, lett them alone
ffor thou wilt loue lesse when they are gone.
Oh bee content, that some loiwde squeaking Cryer
Will pleas'd with one leane-threed-bare Groate for hire
Maie like a Deuill roare, through euerie Streete,
And gall the finders Conscience if they meete.
Or lett mee creepe to some >d%Vread< Coniurer
W%5ch%6 with fantastique Scheame>s< fulfills much Paper,
W%5ch%6 hath devided Heauen in Tenementes
And with Whores, Theeues, & Murtherers stuft her rentes
Soe full, that thoughe hee passe them all in Sinn,
Hee leaves himself noe roome to enter in.
And if when all his Art, and time is spent,
Hee saie, t'will nere bee found, oh bee content,
Receiue from him the doome vngrudginglie,
Because hee is the Mouthe of Destenie.
Thou saiest, alas! the Gold doth still remaine
Thoughe it bee chaunged, and putt into a Chaine.
Soe in the first-falne Angells resteth still
Wisedome, and knowledge, but tis tur'nd to ill,
As those should doe good workes, and should provide [CW: Necessities]
Necessities but now must nurse thy Pride. [f. 22v]
And they are still bad Angelles, myne are none
ffor forme giues beeing and their forme is gone.
Pittie theis Angelles, yet their dignities
Passe vertuous powers, and principalities.
But thou art resolute; Thy will bee done,
Yet with such anguishe as her onelie Sonne
The Mother in the hungrie grave doth laye,
Vnto the fire those Martyrs I betraye.
Good Soules, for yow giue life to euerie thing
Good Angells, for good Messages yow bring.
Desty'nd yow might haue bene to such an One,
As would haue lov'd, and worshipt yow alone.
One w%5ch%6 would suffer hungar, nakednes;
Yea death, >or%>ere< hee would make yo%5r%6 number lesse.
But I am guiltie of your sadd decaye
May your fewe fellowes longer with mee staye.
But oh thou wretched finder, whome I hate
Soe much, that I almost pittie thy State;
Gold being the heaviest Mettaile amongst all,
Maie my most heavie Curse vpon thee fall.
Heere fettered, manacled, and han'gd in Chaines,
ffirst maist thou bee, then chaind in hellish paines.
Or bee with forraigne Gold, bri'bd to betraye
Thy Countrie, and faile both of that, and thy Paye. [CW: Maie.]
Maie the next thing, thou stoop'st to reach contayne [f. 23r
Poison, whose nimble fume rotte thy mo>%Vi<st brayne.
Or libelles, or some interdicted thing
W%5ch%6 negligentlie kept, thy ruine bring.
Lust-bredd Disseases rotte thee, and dwell w%5th%6 thee,
Itchie desire, and noe abilitie.
Maie all the hurt, w%5ch%6 euer Gold hath wrought
All mischeifes, w%5ch%6 all Deuilles euer thought;
Want after Plentie, poore and gowtie Age
The plagues of Trauailers, Loue, and Mariage
Afflict Thee, and at thy lifes latest moment
Maie thy swolne Sinnes themselves to thee present.
But I forgive: Repent then honest Man
Gold is restoratiue, Restore it then
Or if with it thou bee'st, loath to depart
Because tis cordiall would t'were at thy hart.|
