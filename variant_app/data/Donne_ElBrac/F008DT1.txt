 Not that in Collour it was like thy haire
 for Armelets of that, thou maist let mee weare;
 nor y%5t%6 thys hand it ofte embrace'd, and kist,
 for soe it had y%5t%6 good w%5ch%6 ofte I mist:
 nor for y%5t%6 silly old morality,
 that as those links are tied, our loue should bee,
 Mourne I: that I thy 7. fold chaine haue lost,
 nor for the luck sake, but the bitter cost.
 Oh shall 12. righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
 noe leauen of vild soder did admitt;
 nor yet by any fault haue straid, & gone
 from the first state of their creation;
 Angells w%5ch%6 heauen commanded to prouide[cw:all]
 All things to mee, & bee my faithfull guide;[f.26]
 to gaine newe friends, to appease great enemies,
 to comfort my soule when I lye, or rise,
 shall these 12. Innocents, by thy seuere
 sentence, dread Iudge, my sinns great burthen beare?
 shall they bee damn'd, and in the furnace throwne,
 and punish'd for offences not their owne?
 they saue not mee; they doe not ease my paines;
 When in y%5t%6 hell they'are burnt, & tyed in chaynes.
 were they but crownes of ffrance I car'de not,
 for most of them their naturall countrey rott
 I thinke possesseth; they come here to vs
 Soe leane, soe lame, soe pale, soe ruinous;
 and howesoere ffrench kings most christian bee,
 their crownes are circumcis'de most Iewishly;
 or were they spanish stamps, still trauellinge
 that are become as Catholique as their kinge.
 those vnlick'd beare-whelps; vnfilld pistoletts,
 that more then Cannon shott, aveiles, or letts;
 w%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded, look
 like many=angled figures in the book
 of some great Coniurer, w%5ch%6 would enforce
 nature, as these doe iustice from her course;
 w%5ch%6, as the soule quickens head, feet, & heart;
 as streames like veines, run through th'earths euery part,
 visit all countreyes, and haue slily made
 Gorgeous ffrance, ruin'd, ragged, and decayed;
 Scotland, w%5ch%6 knewe noe state, prowde in one day
 and mangled .17. headed Belgia:
 or were it such gold as that, wherew%5th%6all,
 almighty Chimycks from each Minerall
 haueing by subtle-fire a soule out-pull'd,
 are durtily, and desperatly gull'd,[cw:I#would]
 I would not spitt to quench the fire, they were in,[f.26v]
 for they are guiltie of much hainous sinn; 
 but shall my harmless angells perish?  shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my all?
 much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish, wilbee dead,
 much of my able youth, and lustyhead
 will vanish, if thou loue, let them alone,
 for thou wilt loue mee lesse, when they are gone:
 Oh bee content y%5t%6 some loude squeaking Crier
 Well pleas'd w%5th%6 one leane thred-bare groat for hier,
 may like a Deuill roare through euery street,
 and gall the finders conscience, if they meete,
 or lett mee creepe to some dread Coniurer,
 w%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastique scenes, fulfills much paper
 w%5ch%6 haue diuided heauen in tenements,
 and w%5th%6 whores, theeues, & murtherers, stuffd her rents
 soe full, y%5t%6 though hee pass them all in sinn,
 hee leaues himself noe roome to enter in;
 and if when all his art, and tyme is spent
 hee say, t'will nere bee found (oh bee content)
 receiue from him the doome vngrudgingly,
 because hee is the mouth of Destinye,
 thou say'st alass, y%5e%6 gold doth still remaine
 though it bee chaung'd, & putt into a chaine:
 soe in the first fall'n Angells resteth still
 wisdome, & knowledge, but t'is turn'd to ill:
 as these should doe good works, and should prouide
 necessities, but nowe must nurse thy pride;
 and they are still bad Angells, mine are none
 for forme giues being, and their forme is gone
 pitty these Angells yet, their dignities
 passe Vertues, powers, & principallities,
 but thou art resolute, they will bee done
 Yet w%5th%6 such an anguish, as her only sonne[cw:the]
 the mother in y%5e%6 hungrie graue doth laye,[f.27]
 vnto the fire, these martyrs I betraye.
 good soules, for you giue life to euery thinge,
 good angells, for good messages you bringe,
 destin'd yo%5u%6 might haue beene to such a one
 as would haue lou'd, & worshipp'd you alone.
 one w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger, nakednesse, 
 yea death ere hee would make yo%5r%6 nomber lesse,
 but I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sad decaye,
 may yo%5r%6 fellowes w%5th%6 mee longer stay. 
 But oh thou wretched finder, whom I hate
 soe much, that I almost pittie thy estate 
 Gold being the heauiest mettall amongst all,
 may my most heauy curse vpon thee fall,
 here fettred, manacled, & hang'd in chaines
 first maist thou bee, then chain'd to hellish paines,
 or bee w%5th%6 forraine gold brib'de to betray
 thy countrey, & faile both of y%5t%6, and thy paye.
 may the next thinge thou stoop'st to reach, conteine
 poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moist braine.
 or libells, or some interdicted thinge
 w%5ch%6 negligently kept, thy ruine, bring.
 Lust-bred diseases, rott thee, & dwell w%5th%6 thee
 Itchy desire, and noe abilitie,
 may all the hurt y%5t%6 euer gold hath wrought
 all mischiefes w%5ch%6 all deuills euer thought,
 want after plenty, poore, and gowty age
 the plagues of trauellers, loue, and marriage
 afflict thee, and at thy liues latest moment,
 may thy swolne sinns themselues to thee present.
 but I forgiue, repent thou honest man,
 gold is restoratiue, restore it than.  
 or if w%5th%6 it thou beest loath to depart
 because t'is cordiall; would twere at thy heart.
