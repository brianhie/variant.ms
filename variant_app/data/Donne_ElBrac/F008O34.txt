 Shall those 12 Innocentes, by thy seueare
 Sentence (dread Iudge), my sinnes great burden beare
 And punisht for offences not there owne
 Shall they be damned, and in the furnace throwne.
 They saue not me, they doe not ease my paynes
 When in that hell they are %Yrapt%Z >burnt< and tyed in chaynes
 W%Ye%Zere they but crownes of ffrance, I cared not

 So pale, so lame, >leprous< so leane, so ruinous,
 And howsoere french kinges Most [Chi-rho]ian bee
