Not that in colo%5r%6 it was like thy haire
for armelettes of that thou maist let me weare
nor that thie hand it oft embrac't and kist
for soe it had that good w%5c%6h oft I mist
nor for that seelie ould morallitie
that as those linckes are tied our loues should be
Mourne I, that I thie seauenfold chaine haue lost
nor for the lacke sake but the bitter cost
O shall twelue righteous angels w%5c%6h as yet
no leaven of vile soder did admitt
nor yet by any taint haue straid or gone
from the first state of there creation
Angells w%5c%6h heaven comanded to prouide
all thinges to me and be my faithfull guide.
to gaine newe frends to appease great enemies
to comfort my soule when I lie or rise
shall theis twelue innocentes by thy seuere
sentence dread iudge my synnes great burthen beare
shall they be damn'd and in the furnace throwne
and punished for offences not their owne
they %Ysawe%Z>%5see%6< not me they do not ease my paines
When in that hell they are burn'd and tied in Chaines
Were they but Crownes of frannce I cared not
for most of them their naturall countrey rott
I thinke possesseth, they come heere to vs
so leane so pale, soe lame so ruinous
And howso'ere french kings most Christian be
their Crownes are circu%Mcised most iewishelie
or were they Spanish stamps still travellinge
and->>that< are become as Catholicke as there kinge
Those vnlicked beare whelps vnfiled pistolettes
that %Ywere%Z more then Canon shotts availe or lets
w%5c%6h necligently left vnrounded looke
like many angled figures in the booke
of some great coniurer, w%5c%6h wold enforce %Ynature%Z
nature as theis doe iustice from her course
w%5c%6h as the sowle quickens head feet and hart
as streames like vaines run%M through the'rths eu%5r%6y part
visit all countreys and haue slilie made
gorgeous frannce ragged, ruin'd and decaide.
Scotland w%5c%6h knewe no state prov'd in one daye
and mangled seauenteene headed belgia.
Or were it such gould as that wherewithall
almightie Chimicke from eache minirall
having by subtile fire a soule out puld
are durtlie and desperatelie gul'd
I would not spitt to quench the fire they were in
for they are guiltie of much heinous synnes
But shall my harmeles angels perish, shall
I lose my gard my food my ease my all?
much hope w%5c%6h they should nourish wilbe dead
much of my hable youth and lustieheade
will vanish: if thou loue me, let them alone
for thow wilt loue me less when they are gone
Oh be content that some lowd squeaking crier
well pleas'd w%5t%6h one leane thrid bare grote for hier [CW:May]
Maie like a deuill roare throughe everie street
and gall the finders conscience if they meete.
or let me creepe to some dradd Coniurer
w%5c%6h w%5t%6h fantasticke scheames fills full much paper
who hath deuided heaven in tenem%5tes%6.
and with whoores, theeves and murtherers stuft his rentes
so full that thoughe he pass them all in sinne
he leaues himselfe no rowme to enter in
and if when all his time and art is spent
he saie t'will ne're be founde, oh be content
receiue the Doome from him vngrudginglie
because he is the mouth of Destenie
Thou saiest alas the gould doth still remaine
thoughe it be chang'd and putt into a chaine
So in those first falne angels resteth still
Wisdome and knowledge, but it is turn'd to ill.
As theis should doe good workes and should proude
necessities, but now must nurse thie pride.
And they are still bad angells, mine are non
for forme giues beinge, and there forme is gone:
Pittie theis angels yet their dignities
pass Vertues powers and principalities.
But thow art resolute thie will be done
yet with such anguish as her onely sonne
the mother in the hungrie graue doth laie
Vnto the fire theis Martirs I betraie
Good sowles for yo%5u%6 giue life to everie thinge
good angells for good messadges yo%5u%6 bringe
Destin'd yo%5u%6 might haue bene to such a one
as wold haue lov'd and worshipt yo%5u%6 alone
one who wold suffer hunger, nakednes
yea deathe e're he wold make your number less
But I am quiltie of your sadd decaye
Maie your fewe fellowes longer with me staie
But oh thow wretched finder whom I hate
so much, as I almost pittie thy state
Gould being y%5e%6 bravest mettall amongst all
maie my most heavie curse vpon thee fall
Heere fettred manacles and hang'd in chaines
first maist thow be then chain'd to hellish paines
or be with forren gold hir'd to betraye
thy Countrey, and faile both of that and of thy paie
Maie the next thinge thow stoopest to reach conteine
Poison whose nimble fume rott thy moist braine
or libells, or some interdicted thinge
w%5c%6h necligentlie kept thie ruine bringe
lust bredd diseases rott thee and dwell with thee
Itchie desire and not habilitie
Maie all y%5e%6 hurt w%5c%6h ever gould hath wrought
all mischeefes, w%5c%6h all deuils ever thought
Want after plentie, poore and gowtie age
the plague of travellers, loue and marriadge
afflict thee, and at thy liues last moment
Maie thie swolne sinnes themselues to thee present [CW:But]
But I forgiue repent thow honest man [f.25r
Gold is restoratiue restore it then
or if with it thow beest loth to depart
Because t'is cordiall would t'were at thy hart.
