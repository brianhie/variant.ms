 Not that in coolor it was like thy haire:
 (for Armeletts of that, thou canst let mee weare)
 Nor that thy hand it ought embrac't & kist
 (though so it had the good that oft I mist)
 Nor for the syllye owld moriality->>morality<,
 (that as these->>those< links were ty'ed, ou%5r%6 lov's should bee,)
 Mourne I y%5t%6 thy seavenfold chayne I haue lost,
 not for the luck sake but for the bitter cost.
 Oh shall twelue righteous Anngells y%5t%6 as yett
 no leaven of vild fodder did admytt,
 nor yet (by any taynts haue strayd or gon
 from the first state of their creation.
 Angells, W%5ch%6 Heaven com%Manded to provide
 all things for mee, & bee my p%Pfect guide;
 to gayne new frends, ta'ppease great enem/yes
 To comfort my Sowle, When I ly & rise;
 Shall theise twelue ynnocents, by thy fevers
 Sentence (dread Iudge,) my sinnes great burden bear
 shall they be dam'd, & in the furnace throwne
 & punished for offenses not their owne?
 They saue not mee, they do not ease my paynes
 When that in hell they are burnt & ty'ed in chaynes
 Were they but Crownes of Fraunce, I cared not 
 for most of them their naturall cuntry rott, [CW:om]
 I think, possesseth, They com here to vs [77r]
 so lame, so leane, so pale so ruynous
 And howere ffrench kings most Christian bee,
 their Crownes are circumcised most Iewishly.
 Or were they Spanish stampe still traveling,
 that are becom as Catholick as their king:
 those vnlickt Bear=whelps, vnfild Pistoletts,
 that more then cannon shott availes or letts,
 W%5ch%6 (negligently %Ywent%Z->>left< vnrounded) lookes->>looke<
 lyke many angling figures in the bookes->>booke<,
 of some dread Coniurer, W%5ch%6 would enforce
 nature, as theise do iustice from her course.
 W%5ch%6 (as the Soule quickens head, foote & heart,
 as streames like vaynes runne through y%5e%6 earth's eche /part
 Visit all %Y*******%Zcountries & haue slily made
 gorgeous fraunce ragged, ruynd & decayde:
 Scotland w%5ch%6 knew no state, proud in one daye,
 & mangled seaventene headed Belgia,
 Or were it such gold, as y%5t%6 where=with all,
 almightie Chymmycks from each mynerall
 having with subtill fyre a Mercury outpulle->>outpulld<
 are durtily & desperatly gulle->>gulld<
 I would not spitt to quench, >%Vthe#fire< they were in.
 ffor they are guilty of much haynous syn [CW:om]
 But shall my harmeless Angells p%Pish all, [77v]
 I loese my guard, my ease, & eek my all,
 much hope, w%5ch%6 they did nourish will be dead,
 much of my able youth & lusty head
 Will vanish; If thou love but them alone,
 for thou wilt love me less when they are gone
 Oh be content that some loud=squeaking cryar
 Well pleasd with one leane threed=bare groat for >%Vhis< hier
 may like a devill roare through every streat,
 & gaule the finders conscience, if they meet,
 Or lett mee creep to some dread Coniurer,
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastiq%Q schemes fills so much pap%P,
 W%5ch%6 hath devided heaven in tenements:
 & w%5th%6 whores, theeves, murderers, stuft their rents,
 so full, that though hee pass them all in synn,
 hee leaves himself no roome to enter in.
 And if (when all his art & tyme is spent)
 hee say t'will ne're be found, oh be content,
 receiue the doome from him vngrudgingly
 because hee is the mouth of destiny.
 Thou sayest, alas, y%5e%6 gould doth still remayn,
 though it be turnd p%Phapps into a chayne.
 So in those first faln Angells resteth still
 Wisdom & knowledge, but tis turnd to ill,
 (as theise should do good works & should p%Puid/e
 necessaries, but now must nurse thy pryde. [CW:om]
 And they are still bad Angells, myne are none [78r]
 for forme giues being, & their forme is gone.
 Pitty theise Angells yet; their dignities,
 pass virtues, powers, & principalityes.
 But thou art resolute, thy will be done,
 yet with such anguish, as her only sonne
 the loving mother in the grave doth laye,
 vnto the fyre theise Angells I betraye.
 good Soules, for you giue life to everie thing,
 good Angells, for good messages you bring.
 destin'd yo%5u%6 might haue ben to such a one,
 as woul'd haue lov'd, & worship't you alone.
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger, nakedness,
 yea death, ere hee %Yy**%Zwould make yo%5u%6 numberless.
 But I am guilty of your sadd decaye,
 may your few fellowes longer w%5th%6 me staye.
 But oh thou wretched fynder, whom I hate,
 So much I almost pitty thine estate,
 gould being heavi'est mettall, amongst all
 may my most heavy curse, vpon thee fall.
 heere fettered, manacled, & hangd in Chaynes,
 fast mayest thou be, then chayn'd in hellish paynes
 or be with forreyne, brybed to %Ybet**ye%Zbetraye
 thy country, & faile both in y%5t%6, & in thy %Jweigh%K /var:>paye< [CW:om]
 May the next thing thou stoopest to reach co%Mtayn [78v]
 poison, who%5s%6 nimble fume, rott thy moist brayn
 Or libells, or some interdicted thing,
 being negligentlie kept thy ruine bring.
 lust=bred diseases rott thee & dwell with thee
 Itchy desires, without abilitie.
 May all the hurt y%5t%6 gould hath ever wroug\ht
 all mischiefs, which all deuills ever thought
 want after plenty, poore & gowty age,
 The plaugues of Travellers, love & mariage,
 afflict thee, & at thy lyves last moment
 may Devills thy swolne synnes to thee p%Psent
 But I forgiue; Repent then honest man
 Gould is restoratiue, restore it than.
 But if with it, thou beest loth to dep%Pt
 because 'tis cordiall: Would twere at thy /hart
 [om] whirlwind flourish
