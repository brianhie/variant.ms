Not that in colour it was like thy haire
ffor armelettes, of y%5t%6 thow mightes lett me weare
Nor that thy hand it ofte imbrac'd & kist
ffor soe it had the good which ofte I miste
Nor for that silly old morrality 
That as these luckes were built our loue should be
Mourne I That I thy seauenfold chayne hade loste. 
Nor for the linke sake But the bitter coste
Oh shall twelue %Yangels%Z righteous angels which as yet
Noe leuen of vild sodder did Admitt,
Nor yet be->>by< any fault, haue straid or gon,
from the first state of their creation
Angels which heauen co%Mmannded to prouide
All thinges to me to be my faithfull guild->>guide<
To gaine new frendes to appease great enemies,
to comfort my soule where I lie or rise
Shall these 12 innocentes by thy seuere
Sentence hard iudge) my sinnes gret burthen beare
Shall they be damned & in the furnace throwne
And punisht for offences not their owne
They saue not me they do not ease my paines,
While y%5t%6 in hell theyre burnt & tied in chaines
wh->Were they but crownes of ffraunce I cared not
ffor most of these their naturall cuntries rott
I think possesseth; they come here to vs
So pale so lame so leane so ruinous
And howsoere ffrench kinges most Christian be
Their crownes are circu%Mcised most Iewishly
Or were they Spanish stampe still treuailinge
That are becom'd as catholike as their king
Whose vnlickt Barewhelpes vnfilde Pistolls
That more then como%M shott auailes & lettes
That negligently lefte vnrounded looke
Like many Angled figures in the booke
Of somme greate coniurer that would enforce
Nature as these do Iustice from hir course
That like the sowle runne through out >%^%5head%6< feet & hart
As stremes like vaines run throughout earths eu%5r%6y p%Pte
Visitt all Cuntries & haue slily made
Gorgious ffraunce so ruined ragged & decaied 
Scotland (that knew no state) proud in one day
And mangled seauen headed Belgia
Or weare it such Gould as that wherwith all
Almighty Chimistes from each Mynerall
Haueing by subtill fire a soule out-pulde
Are durtely & desperately guld
I woult not spitt to quench the fire there in
ffor they are guilty of much haynous sinne
But shall my harmelesse angels perishe; shall 
I loose my gard my life my ease my all
Much that they should nourishe wilbe dead
Much of my able youth & liuely head
Will vanishe; If thow love let that->>thay< alone
ffor thow wilt love me lesse when they are gon
Oh be content that some loud squeaking crier
Well pleas'd w%5th%6 one leane thredbare groat for hire
May like a Deuill roare through euery streete
And gall the finders conscience if they meete
Or let me crye to some dread Coniurer
That with fantasticke scheames fulfilles much paper
That hath deuided heauen in tenem%5tes%6, 
And with whores theeues & Murderers stuft his Rentes
Soe full that (though he passe them all in sinne
he leaues himselfe no roome to enter in
And if when all his art & thine is spent
He say twill nere be found yet be content
Receiue from him that Doome vngrudgingly 
Because he is the mouth of destinie 
Thow sayest (alas) that Gould doth still remaine
Though it be changed & turned into a chaine
Soe in the first fall in Angells rested still
Wisdome & knowledge but tis turned to ill
As these should doe good workes & should p%Puide,
Necessities But now must nurse thy pride

Pittie these angells yet their dignities
Passe virtues powers & Principallities
But thow art Resolute; thy wilbe done
Yet w%5th%6 such anguish as her only sonne
The mother in the hongry graue doth lay
Vnto the fire theise Martirs I betray
Good soules: for yow giue life to euery thing
Good angeles: for good messages yow bringe
Destined yow might haue bin to such a one
That would haue loved & Worshipt yow alone
One y%5t%6 would suffer hunger nakednesse
Yea Death ere he would make yo%5r%6 number lesse
but I am guilty of yo%5r%6 sad decay
May your fewe fellowes longer with me staye
But (oh thow wretched finder) whom I hate
Soe, that I allmost pittie thy estate
Gold being the heuiest mettall amonge all
May my most heauy curse vpon the fall
Heere fettered, manacled & tied in chaines
ffirst maist thow be then tide in hellish paines
Or be with fforraine gold bribde to betray
Thy country & faile both of that & paye
May the first thinges thow stoopest to reach containe
Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moist braine
Or Libelles or some interdicted thing
w%5ch%6 negligently kept thy Ruine bringe
Lust bred diseases rott thee & dwell with thee
Itches desire & noe Abilitie
May all the euilles that gold euer wrought
All mischefes that all Deuilles euer thought
Want after Plentie; poore & gowtie age
The plague of Trauailers, Love, mariage,
Afflict thee & att thy liues last moment
May thy swolne sinnes themselues to the present
But I forgiue, Repente, thee honest man
Gold is restoratiue restore it then
But if from it thow beest lothe to parte->>departe<
Because t'is cordiall I would twere att thy hart
