 Not that in colour it was like thy hayre;
 For (armletts off) that still thou letst mee weare:
 Nor that thine hand it oft embrac't & kist;
 For so it had that good which oft I mist:
 Nor for that silly old moralitie,
 That as those links are chaynd, our souls should bee,
 Mourne I, that I thy seven fold chayne have lost,
 Nor for lucks sake: but for that bitter cost.
 Oh shall twelve righteous Angells, which as yett
 No leaven of vile infection did admitt,
 Nor yet by any fate have strayd, or gone
 From the first state of theyr creation;
 Angells which heaven com%Maunded to provide
 All things for mee, & bee my faythfull guide:

 Shall these twelve Innocents, by thy severe
 Iudgement (dread Iudge) my sins great burden beare? [CW:Shall]
 Shall these bee damnd, & in the fornace throwne? [p.201]
 And punisht for offences not theyr owne?
 They save not mee, they doe not ease my payne,
 When that in hell they're burnt, & tyed in chains.
 Were they but crownes of France I cared not:
 For most of them theyr naturall countries rott
 I thinke possesseth: they come here to vs
 So leane, so lame, so pale, so ruinous.
 And howsoere French kings most Christian bee
 They circumcise theyr Crowns most Iewishly.
 Or were they Spanish stamps, still travelling
 That are become as Catholicke, as theyr king,
 These vnlicked beare whelps, vnfil'd pistoletts
 That more then Canon shott avayls, or letts,
 Which negligently left vnrounded, looke
 Like many angled figures in the booke
 Of some great Conjurer; that would infore
 Nature (as some doe Iustice) from her course.

 Or were it such gold as that, wher-withall
 High mighty Chymicks, from each minerall  
 Having by subtile fire a Soule outpulld
 Are durty, and most desperately gulld,
 I would not spitt, to quench the fire they'r in:
 For they are guilty of much haynous sinne.
 But shall my righteous Angells perish? shall
 I loose my life, mine ease, my guard & all?
 Much hope, which these should nourish, will bee dead, [CW:Much#of]
 Much of my able youth, & lusty head [p.202]
 Will vanish.  If thou love, lett y.%5m%6 alone;
 For thou wilt love mee lesse, when they are gone:
 And bee content, that some loud squeaking cryer,
 Content with one leane threedbare groat for hire,
 May like a Divell roare through every streete,
 And gall the finders conscience if they meete.
 Or lett mee creepe to some dread Conjurer
 That with fantastique lines fills much pa-per;
 That hath divided hell in tenements,
 And with whores, theevs, & murtherers stufft his rents
 So full, that though hee passe y%5m%6 all in sinne,
 Hee leaves no roome for him to enter in.
 And if, when all his time & art is spent,
 There will bee nothing found: yet bee content,
 Receive from him thy doome vngrudgingly,
 Because hee is the mouth of Destiny.
 Alas, thou sayst, the Gold doth yet remayne:
 Though it bee changde, & turned to a Chaine.
 So in the first falln Angells resteth still
 Wisdome & Knowledge, but 'tis turnd to ill:
 As these, should doe good works, & should provide
 Things necessary, now must nurse thy pride.

 But I am guilty of your sadd decay:
 May its fellowes with mee no longer stay. [CW:/But#thou]
 But thou (o%C wretched finder) whom I hate [p.203]
 So much that I almost pitty thy state;
 Gold being the heavyest mettall, amongst all;
 May my most heavy curse vpon thee fall.
 Heere fetterd, manacled, & tyed in chaynes
 First mayst thou bee; then chaynd in hellish paines.
 
 
 May the next thing thou stoopst to reach, containe
 Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst brayne.
008.F09.101om
008.F09.102om
 Lust-bredd diseases rott thee; and dwell with thee
 Itchy desires, and noe ability.
 May all the ill that ever Gold hath wrought
 All mischiefe that the Divells ever thought:
 Want after plenty; poore and gouty age
 The plague of traveller; love, marriage
 Afflict thee: and at thy lifes last moment 
 May thy swolne sins themselves to thee present.
 But I forgive: repent thou honest man.
 Gold is restorative: restore it than.
 But yet, if from it thou art loath to parte,
 Because 'tis cordiall, would twere at thy heart.
