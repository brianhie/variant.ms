Much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish wilbe deade
Much of my able youth & lustie heade
Will vanish, if thou let them alone
But thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone

Well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane threadbare groate for hire

All mischeifes w%5ch%6 diuells euer thought

The plauges of trauellers, lame & marriage
Afflict thee: At thy lifes last moment
May thy swolne sinnes them selues to thee p%5r%6sent
But I forgiue, repent thou honest man
