Not that in Couller, it was liek thy haire
for Armeletts of that, thou maist let mee weare
nor that thy hands it of't I'mbrast and kiste
for soe it had that good which oft I miste
Nor for that sillie ould Morall>%^%5i%6<tie
that as these links are tide, our Loues should bee
I mourne: that I thy seauen fould Chaine haue lost
not for luckes sake, but for the bitter Cost
O, shall twelue righteous Angells, which as yet
noe leauen of vilde fodder did at->>admitt<
nor yet by my constraint; haue strid, or gon
from the first state of their Creation
Angells which heauen Commaunded to prouide
all things to mee, and bee my faithfull guide
to gaine new freindes, t'apease great enemies
to comfort my soule, when I lye or rise
shall these twelue innocents, by thy seuere
sentence dread Iudge, my sinns great burden beare
008.PM1.019om
008.PM1.020om
And saue not mee, they doe not ease my paines
when in that Hell th'are burnde and tyde in chaines
were they but Crownes of ffrance I cared not
for most of them, their naturall Cuntrie rott
I thinke possesseth, they come here to vs
Soe leane, soe lame, soe ruinous
and howsoere, most ffrench Kings Christians bee
their Crownes are Circumcisde, most Iewishly
Or weare the Spanish stampes, still trauellinge
that are become as Catholike as their Kinge
those vnlike beare-whelpes, vnfield pistoletts
that more then Canon shott, Auailes or letts
which negligently lefte vnrounded; 'looke
Like manie Angled Iegaries, in a->>y%5e%6< booke
of some great Coniurer, which  would enforce
Nature (as these do Iustice) from her Course
            
as streames, like vaines run through y%5e%6 earth each parte
Visitt all Cuntries, and haue slyly made
Gorgeous ffrance ragged, ruinde and decaide
Scotland (which knowes no state) in one day
And mangled seuenteen headed Belgia,
Or were it such gould, as that were with all
Almightie Chimiks from each minerall
haueinge by subtile fire a soule out pulde
Are durtely and desperately gulde   [126
I would not spett to quench that fire they were in
for they are guilty of much haynous sinn
But shall my harmeless Angells perish, shall
I loose my guarde, my ease, my foode my all,
much hope which they nourish, will bee dead:
much of my able youth, and lustie head
will vanish: If thou Loue mee let them alone
for thou wilt Loue mee less when they are gon
Oh bee content, that some Lou'de Squeaking Cryer
well pleasde with one leane threed-bare, groate for hire
May like a Deuill roare through euery streete
and gall the finders Conscience, if hee him meet
Or lett mee Creepe to some dreade Coniurer
which with fantasticke Scheames fills full much paper
who hath diuided Heauen in tenements
And with whores, theeues, and Murderers stuffe his rents
soe full, that though hee pass them all in sinn
hee leaues himselfe no rome to enter in
And if when all his Arte and tinne is spent
hee say twill not bee found: O bee Content
receiue the Doome from him vngrudgingly
because hee is the Mouth of Desteny.
Thou sayst alas the goulde doth still remaine
though it bee chaingde, and put into a Chaine
Soe in those first falne Angells, resteth still
wisdome and knowledge but tis turnd to ill,
As these should doe good workes, and should prouid
Necessaries; but now must nurse thy pride
And they are still bad Angells, mine are none
for formes giue being, and their formes are gone
Pittie the Angells yett their dignities
pass vertus, powrs, and principalities
But thou art resolute: thy will be don%Me
yet with such anguish as her only sonne
the Mother in the hungrie graue doth lay
vnto the fire, the Martyrs I betray
Good soules, for yee giue life to euery thinge
good Angells, for good Messages you bringe
Destinde you might haue bin, to such a one
As would haue Lou'de and worshipt you a lone
One who would %Yhaue%Z suffer hunger, Nakednesse
Yea Death eare hee would make you numberless [127
But I am guilty of your sad decay
May your few fellows longer with mee stay
But O thou wretched finder, whom I hate
Soe much that I almost, pittie thy state
Gould beinge the heauiest mettall amongst all
may most heauy Curse vppon thee fall
ffetterd, and manacled and hangd in Chaines
first maist thou bee, then chaind to hellish paines
Or being with forren gould, bribde to betray
thy Cuntrie, faile both of that, and thy pay
May the next thing thou stoopst to reach Containe
Poyson, whose nimble fume, rott thy moyst braine
Or some libell, or inter dicted thinge
Kept negligently may thy ruine bringe
Lust bred diseases rott thee: and dwell with thee
Itchie desire, and no abillitie
May all the hurt which euer gould hath wrought
all mischeifes, which all Deuills euer thought
want after plenty, poore and gowty Age,
the plague of trauellers Loue, and Mariage
afflict thee; and at thy Liues last moment
may thy swolne sinns, to thee themselues p%5r%6sent:
But I forgiue thee, repent then honest man
gould is restoratiue, restore it than
But yet if from it thou beest loath to parte
Because tis Cordiall, would t'were at thy heart:.
