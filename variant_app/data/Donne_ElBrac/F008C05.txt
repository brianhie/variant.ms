Angelles which heauen Commanded to prouide
All thinges for me, and be my faythfull guyde
To gayne newe freindes, t'appease greate enemyes
My soule to Comforte when I lye or ryse:                        
Shall these i2 Innocentes by thy seuere                         
Sentence (dreade Iudge) my sinns greate burthen beare           
Shall theye be damned, and in the fornace throwne, [67v         
And punisht for offences, not theyre owne?                      
Theye saue not me, theye doe not ease my paynes                 
When in that hell theye r burnte, and tyde in Chaynes            
Weare theye but Crownes of ffraynce, I Cared not,

Theyre Crownes are Circumsised most Iewishlie                   
Or weare theye Spanishe stampes, still trauillinge              
That are become as Catholiques as theire kinge;                  
Those vnlickt beare-whelpes, vnfylde Pistoletts

Like many angled figures in the booke                           
Of some greate Coniurer whoe woulde inforce

Soe full, that though he passee->>passes< them all in sin
