 Not that in colour it was like thy haire [f. 27]
 for %1Arme letts%2 of that thou mayest lett me weare
 Nor that thy hand itt oft embracst and kiste
 for so itt had that good w%5ch%6 oft I miste
 Nor for that silie old %1Morralitie%2
 That as those linckes were tied our loue should bee
 %1Mourne%2 I that I thy seauen fold chaine haue lost
 Nor for the lucke sake but the bigger cost
 Oh shall twelue righteous %1Angells%2 w%5ch%6 as yett
 No leauen of vile %1Soder%2 did admitt
 Nor yett by any fault haue strayed or gone
 ffrom the first state of their %1Creation%2
 %1Angells%2 w%5ch%6 heauen commanded to prouide
 All thinges to mee and bee my faithfull guide
 To gayne new frendes to appease great enimies
 to comfort my soule when I lie or rise
 Shall these twelue %1Innocents%2 by thy seuer
 Sentence dread Iudge my sinnes great burden beare
 Shall they be damnd and in the fornace throwne
 And punishd for Offences not their owne
 They saue not mee they doe not ease my paines
 When in that %1Hell%2 they are burnt and tied in chaynes
 Were they but %1Crownes%2 of ffrance I cared not
 ffor most of them their naturall Country rott
 I thinke possesseth! they come here to vs
 So leane so pale so lame so ruinous
 And how so ere french %1kings%2 most Christian bee
 Their Crownes are circumcisd most Iewishly
 Or were they spanish stampes still trauailing
 That are become as %1Catholique%2 as their Kinge
 Those vnlickd %1Bearewhelpes%2 vnfild %1Pistoletts%2
 That more then cannon shott auailes or letts
 W%5ch%6 negligently left vnrounded looke
 Like many Angled figures in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer which would inforce
 Nature as those doe Iustice from their course
 Which as the soule quickens head feet and hart
 Of streames like vaynes runnes thorough the earthes eu%5er%6y part
 Visitt all Countries and haue slilie made
 %1Gorgeous France%2 ruind ragged and decayd
 %1Scotland%2 w%5ch%6 knewe no state proud in one day
 And mangled seauenteene headed %1Belgia%2
 Or were itt such gold as that where withall
 Almightie %1Chimicks%2 from each %1Minerall%2
 Hauing by subtile fier a soule out pulld
 Are durtilie and desperately gulld
 I would not spitt to quench the fier they were in
 ffor they are guiltie of much hainous sinne
 But shall my harmeles %1Angells%2 perish shall
 I loose my %1Guard%2 my head my foot my all?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish wilbe dead
 Much of my able youth and %1Lustiehead%2
 Will vanish if thou loue lett them alone
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone
 Oh be content that some loud squeaking cryer
 Well pleasd w%5th%6 one leane thredd bare groat for hier
 May like a diuell roare thorough eu%5er%6y street [f. 27v]
 and gall the finders conscience if he meet
 Or lett mee meet with some dread Coniurer
 W%5ch%6 with fantastick %1Sceanes%2 filles full much paper
 Which haue deuided %1Heauen%2 in Tenementes
 And with Whores Theeues and %1Murtherers%2 stuft his rentes
 So full that though he passe them all in sinne
 He leaues himselfe no roome to enter in
 And if when all his Art and time is spent
 he say t'will neere be found (Oh be content
 Receiue from him the doome vngrudginly
 Because he is the mouth of Destinye
 Thou saist alas the gould doth still remaine
 Though it be changd and putt into a chayne
 So in the first fallen %1Angells%2 resteth still
 Wisedome and knowledge but t'is turnd to ill
 As these should doe good woorkes and should prouide
 Necessities but now must nurse thy pride
 And they still badd Angelles mine are none
 ffor forme giues beeing and their forme is gone
 Pittie these %1Angells%2 yett their dignities
 Passe vertues powers and Principalities
 But thou art resolute thy will be done
 Yett w%5th%6 such anguish as her only %1Sonne%2
 The mother in the hungry Graue doth lay
 Vnto the fire these Martirs I betray
 Good soules for yow giue life to eu%5er%6y thinge
 Good %1Angells%2 for good Messages yow bring
 Destind yow might haue beene to such a one
 As would haue loud and woorshippt yow alone
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer %1Hunger Nakednes%2
 Yea death ere he would make your number lesse
 But I am guiltye of your sad decay
 May your fellowes with mee longer stay
 But Oh thou wretched finder whom I hate
 So much that I almost pittie thy state
 %1Gold%2 beeing the heauiest %1Mettall%2 amongst all
 May my most heauy curse vpon thee fall
 Heere fetterd manacled and hangd in chaynes
 ffirst maist thou bee then chaind to hellish paynes
 Or bee w%5th%6 forraigne gold bribd to betray
 Thy country and faile both of that & thy pay
 May the next thing thou stoopst to reach containe
 Poison whose nimble fume rott thy mo>>%Vi<<st brayne
 Or Libells or some %1Interdicted%2 thinge
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept thy ruine bringe
 Lust breed diseases rott the & dwell w%5th%6 thee
 %1Itchy%2 desire and no %1Abilitie%2
 May all the hurt that euer gold hath wrought
 All mischiefes w%5ch%6 all diuelles euer thought
 Want after plentie poore and gowtie age
 The Plagues of Trauailers loue and %1Mariage%2
 %1Aff%2lict thee and att thy liues last moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee present
 But I forgiue repent thou honest man
 %1Gold%2 is restoratiue restore itt then
 Or if with itt thou beest loth to depart
 Because t'is %1Cordiall%2 would twere att thy hart
 %1finis%2
