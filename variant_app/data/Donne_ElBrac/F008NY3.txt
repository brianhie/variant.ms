 Not y%5t%6 in color it was like thy haire
 For armelets of that thou maist let me weare;
 Nor y%5t%6 thy hand it ofte embrac'd & kist,
 For so it had that good, w%5ch%6 ofte I mist,
 Nor for y%5t%6 sely old moralitee
 That as those Lincks are tyed o%5r%6 loue should bee
 Mourne I: y%5t%6 I thy seuenfold chayne haue lost
 Nor for y%5e%6 lucks sake but the bitter cost.
 Oh shall twelve righteous Angels w%5ch%6 as yet
 No leauen of vile sodder did admitt;
 Nor yet by any taint haue stray'd or gone
 From the first State of ther%>>the< Creation;
 Angels w%5ch%6 heauen com%Manded to prouide
 All things to me, and be my faythfull guide
 To gayne new frinds, to'appease great enemyes
 To comfort my Soule when I ly or rise;
 Shall these twelue innocents, by thy seuere
 Sentence, dradd Iudge, my sins great burden beare?
 Shall they be damn'd and in y%5e%6 furnace throwne
 And punisht for offenses, not their owne.
 They saue not me, they do not ease my paynes
 When in y%5t%6 hell they'are burn'd and tyed in chaynes.
 Weare they but crownes of France, I cared not
 for most of them their naturall cuntry rott
 I thinke possesseth, they come here to vs
 So leane, so pale, so lame, so ruinous,
 And howsoere french kings most Christian bee
 Their crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly.
 Or weare they Spanish Stampes, still trauailing
 That are become as Catholique as their king
 Those vnlick'd beare-whelps, vnfil'd pistolets,
 That more then Canon shotts auayles or letts,
 W%5ch%6 negligently lefte vnrounded looke
 Like many angled figures in y%5e%6 booke 
 Of some great Coniuror, w%5ch%6 would enforce [12v]
 Nature, as these do iustice fro%M her course.
 W%5ch%6, as y%5e%6 Soule quickens head, feete and hart
 As streames like vaynes, run through th'earths euery part
 Visit all Cuntryes, and haue slily made
 Georgeous France ragged, ruynd and decayd
 Scotland w%5ch%6 knew no State proud in one day
 And mangled seuentene headed Belgia;
 Or weare it such gold as y%5t%6, wherwithall
 Allmighty Chimicks fro%M each minerall
 Hauing by subtile fyre a soule out pull'd
 Are durtely and desperatly gulld,
 I would not spitt to quench y%5e%6 fyre they''weare in
 For they are guilty of much haynous sin.
 But shall my harmelesse Angels perish? shall
 I loose my guard, my ease, my food, my all?
 Much hope w%5ch%6 they should nourish wilbe dead
 Much of my able Youth and Lustihead
 Will vanish, if thou Loue let them alone
 for thou wilt loue me lesse, when they are gone:
 Oh be content y%5t%6 some lowd squeaking Crier 
 Well pleas'd w%5t%6 one leane thredbare groat for hyer
 May like a deuill rore through euery Street
 And gall y%5e%6 finders conscience if they meet.
 Or let me creepe to some dradd Coniurer
 W%5ch%6 w%5th%6 fantastique Scheames fullfills much paper,
 W%5ch%6 hath deuided heauen in tenements
 And w%5t%6 whores, theves, & Murderers stuff'd his rents
 So full, y%5t%6 though he passe them all in Sin 
 He leaues himselfe no roome to enter in,
 And if when all his art & time is spent
 He say, t'will neare be found, Oh be content.
 Receaue the doome from him vngrudgingly
 Because he is y%5e%6 Mouthe of destiny.
 Thou sayst, alas the gold doth still remayne
 Though it be changd and put into a Chayne.
 So in those first falne Angels resteth still [13]
 Wisdom & knowledg; but t'is turnd to ill.
 As these should do good works and should prouide
 Necessityes, but now must nource thy pride.
 And they are still bad Angels, myne are none
 for forme giues beeing, & their forme is gone.
 Pity these Angels yet, their dignityes
 Passe Vertues, Powers, and Principalityes.
 But thou art resolute, thy will be donne
 Yet w%5t%6 such anguish, as her only Sonne
 The Mother in the hungry graue doth lay
 Vnto the fyre these Martyrs I betray.
 Good Soules, for you giue Life to euery thing,
 Good Angels, for good Messages you bring,
 Destin'd you might haue been, to such a one
 As would haue lou'd, and worshipd you alone.
 One w%5ch%6 would suffer hunger, nakednes
 Yea deathe eare he would make you numberles.
 But I ame guilty of your sad decay
 May your few fellows longer w%5t%6 me stay.
 But oh thou wretched finder whom I hate
 So much, as I allmost pity thy state;
 Gold beeing the heauiest metall amongst all
 May my most heauy curse vpon thee fall.
 Here fetterd, mannacled, and hangd in Chaines
 first maist thou be, then chaind to hellish paynes.
 Or be w%5t%6 forraign gold bribd to betray
 Thy Cuntry, and fayle both of y%5t%6 and thy pay.
 May the next thing thou stoopst to reach, containe
 Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moist braine:
 Or Libells, or some interdicted thing
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept, thy ruyne bring:
 Lust bred diseases rott thee'and dwell w%5t%6 thee
 Itchy desyre, and no abilitee.
 May all the hurt w%5ch%6 euer gold hath wrought,
 All Mischiefs w%5ch%6 all deuills euer thought,
 Want after plenty, poore and gowty age [13v]
 The plagues of trauailers, Loue and mariage
 Afflict thee, and at thy lifes latest moment
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee present.
 But I forgiue; repent then honest man
 Gold is restoratiue, restore it than.
 Or if w%5t%6 it thou beest loth to depart
 Because t'is cordial, would t'weare at thy hart.
