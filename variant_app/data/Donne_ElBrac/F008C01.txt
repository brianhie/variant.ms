 Not y%5t%6 in color it was like thy haire,
 for armlettes of y%5t%6 thou mayest let me weare:                 
 nor y%5t%6 thy hande it %Yafte%Z>ofte< embrac'd & kist,
 for soe it had y%5t%6 good w%5ch%6 ofte I mist;
 Nor for y%5t%6 sillie ould mor*alitie,
 That as those linkes are tyde o%5r%6 loue should bee
 %Y********%Z>Mourne<I y%5t%6 I thy seuenfould Chayne haue lost:
 Nor for the luck sake, but the bitter Cost,
 Oh shall twelue righteous Angelles w%5ch%6 as yet
 Noe leauen of vilde sodder did admit:
 Nor yet by any fault haue strayd, or gone
 from the first state of there Creation:
 Angelles w%5ch%6 haue Com%Maunded to p%Puide
 All thinges to me & be my faythfull guide,
 To gayne newe freindes, tapeare>to#appeare< great enimies,
 To Com%Mfort my soule when I lye, or ryse*
 Shall these twelue Innocentes, by thy seuere
 Senten*e, dread Iudge, my sinnes great burden beare?
 Shall they be damd, & in y%5t%6 fornace throwne,?
 And punnished for offences not there owne?
 They saue not me, they doe not ease my paynes
 When in y%5t%6 hell theire burnd, & tyde in Chaynes.
 Were they but Crounes in ffrance, I cared not
 ffor most of those, theire naturall Cuntry rott
 I thinke possesseth, they %YCume%Z>come< here to vs
 Soe payle, so lame, soe leane, so ruinous.
 {And housoerer ffrench kinges most Christain be
 {There Crounes are Circumsized most Iewishlie
 Or were the spanish stampes still traueling,
 That are become as catholicke as, there king;
 Those vnlickd beare whelpes vnfild'>vnfiled< pistoletes,
 W%5ch%6 more then Cannon shott auayles or lettes.
 W%5ch%6 negligently lefte vnrownded, looke
 Like *any angl'd figures in the booke
 Of some great Coniurer, that would inforce
 Nature, as these doe iustice from her Course,
 That as the soule, quicken head feete & harte,
 As streames, like waynes, runne through th'earths euerie p%Pte,
 Visite all Countries, & haue slylie made
 Georgeous ffrance ragged, ruind, & decayd,
 Scotland w%5ch%6 knew noe state, proud in one day,
 And mangled seuenteene headed Belgia:
 Or were it such gould, as y%5t%6 where w%5th%6 all,
 Almightie Chimmicks from each Minerall. [CW:Hauinge]
 Hauinge by subtill fier a soule out puld>>pull'd<<, [1v]
 Are durtely & desperately guld,
 I would not spite to quench the fier therein,
 ffor they are guiltie of much haynous sinne:
 But shall my harmelesse Angelles perish? shall
 I loose my guard, my life, my ease, my all?
 Much hope, y%5t%6 they should nourish will be dead,
 Much of my able youth, & lustie head:
 Will van%Mish; if thou loue let them alone,
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse, when they are gone.
 Oh be content y%5t%6 som%Me loud squeaking crier,
 Well pleas'd with one leane threedbare grote for hier,
 May like a Diuell Roare through euerie streete
 And gall the finderes Conscience if they meete,
 Or let me creepe to som%Me dread Coniurer
 That w%5th%6 fantastique sceames>steames#or#sceames.#fullfills< %Yfulfills%Z much paper
 That hath deuided heauen in %Yten%M*ets,%Ztenementes
 And w%5th%6 whores, theafes, & murdererers, %Ystufe#his#rents,%Z>stuft#his#rentes,<
 So full, y%5t%6 though' he passe them all in sinne
 They leaue him self noe roome to enter in,
 And if when all his arte & tyme are spente
 he say twill neare be found, oh be contente
 Receaue from him the doome vngrudginly,
 Because he is the mouth of Desteny,
 Then sayest alas the gould doth still remayne
 Though it be Changd' and put into a Chayne,
 So in the first fallen Angells, %Yre**eth%Z>resteth< still
 Wisdom & kn>u<oledge, but it is turned to ill,
 As these should doe good workes & should p%Pvide
 Necessities, but nowe must nurse thy pride
008.C01.075om
008.C01.076om
 Pittie these angells yet, there dignities.
 Passe vertues, powers & principalities,
 But thou arte resolute, thy will be doone,
 But w%5th%6 such %Yan***sh%Z>anguishe< as her only sonn,
 The mother in the hungry graue doth lay,
 Vnto the fier these martires I betray,
 good soules, for you, giue life to every thing,
 good angells, for good messages you bring,
 Destind' you might haue beene to such a one,
 As would haue lou'd[var:>loued,<] & worshipt you alone,
 On that would suffer hunger, nakednesse
 Yea death, eare he would make your number lesse. [CW:om]
 But I guiltie of yo%5r%6 sadd decay [2r]
 may yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer w%5th%6 me stay
 but oh thou wretched finder whom I hate
 so much that I almoste pittie thy state.
 Gould being the heuiest mettall amongst all
 may my most heuie Cursse vpon thee fall.
 here fettred, manacld' & tyde in chaynes
 first mayst thou be then chaynd' to hellish paynes:
 Or be w%5th%6 forraine gould bribd to betray
 Thy cuntrey & fayle both of y%5t%6 & thy pay.
 may the next thing thou stoopst to reach, contayne
 poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst brayne
 Or libells, or som%Me interdicted thinge,
 W%5ch%6 negligently kept, thy ruine bring,
 Lust bredd deseases rott thee & dwell w%5th%6 thee,
 Itchy desyre, & noe abylitie,
 May all the ill w%5ch%6 euer gould hath wrought,
 all mischefes, w%5ch%6 all deuills euer thought,
 want after plentie, poore & %Ygowty%Z>gowtie< age
 The plunges of trauailers, loue, mariage
 Afflict thee, and at thy lives last moment
 may thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee p%Psent.
 but I forgiue, repent then honest man,
 gould is restoratiue, restore it then
 but yf from it thou beest loth to departe
 because tis cordiall would tweare at thy harte.
