 Not y%5t%6 in Color it was like thy haire
 ffor armeletts of y%5t%6 thou mayest let me weare:
 Nor y%5t%6 thy hande it ofte embrac'd & kist,
 ffor soe it had y%5t%6 good w%5ch%6 ofte I mist:
 Nor for y%5t%6 sillie ould moralitye,
 That as those linkes are tyde, o%5r%6 loues should bee,
 Mourne I, y%5t%6 I thy seuenfould Chayne haue lost:
 Nor for the luck sake, but the bitter Cost.
 Oh shall twelue righteous Angells, w%5ch%6 as yet
 Noe leauen of Vilde sodder did admit:
 Nor yet by any fault haue strayed, or gone
 ffrom the first state of there Creation:
 Angells w%5ch%6 %Yhaue%Z->>I< Commaunded to p%Puide
 All thinges to me, & be my faythfull guide,
 To gayne newe frendes, t'apeaze great enimies,
 To Coumfort my soule when I lye, or rise:
 Shall these twelue Innocents, by thy seuere
 Sentence, dreade Iudge, my sinnes great burden beare,
 Shall they be dam'd, & in y%5t%6 fornace throwne,
 And punnished for offences not there owne
 They saue not me, they doe not ease my paynes
 When in y%5t%6 hell the'ire burn'd, & tyd' in Chaynes.
 Were they but Crounes of ffrance, I Cared not,
 ffor moste of those, there naturall Cuntry rott
 I thinke possesseth, they Come* heare to vs
 So payle, so lame, so leane, so ruonous%>ru>>i<<nous,
 And howsoeu%5r%6 ffrench Kinges most Christian bee
 Theire Crounes are Circumsized most Iewishlie;
 Or weare the Spanish stamps still trauelinge,
 That are becom%Me as Catholick as theire Kinge,
 Those vnlickd Beare-whelpes vnfil'd Pistolets,
 W%5ch%6 more then Cannon shott auayles or letts,
 W%5ch%6 necligently lefte vnrounded, looke
 Like many angl'd figures in the booke
 Of som%Me greate Coniurer, y%5t%6 would inforce
 Nature, as these doe Iustice from her Course,
 That (as the soule) >doth< quicken head feete & harte,
 As streames, like Vaynes, runne through th'earths eu%5r%6ie parte
 Visite all Cuntries, & haue slylie made
 Georgeous ffrance ragged, ruind, & decayd:
 Scotland, w%5ch%6 knew noe state, proud in one day,
 And mangled seuenteene-headed Belgia.
 Or weare it such goulde, as y%5t%6 where w%5th%6all
 Almightie Chimicks, from each Minerall,
 Hauinge by subtill fier a soule out puld,
 Are durtely, & desperately guld,
 I would not spite to quench the fier therein, [CW:om]
 ffor they are guiltye of much haynous sinne: [6]
 But shall my harmelesse Angells perish?  shall
 I loose my guard, my life, my ease, my all?
 Much hope, y%5t%6 they should nourish, will bee dead,
 Much of my able youth, & lusty-head
 Will vannish, if thou loue let them alone,
 ffor thou wilt loue me lesse when they are gone.
 Oh be Content y%5t%6 somme loud squeakinge Crier,
 Well pleasd' w%5th%6 one leane%Ye%Z threedbare grote for hyer,
 May like a Diuell roare through eu%5r%6ie streete,
 And gall the finders Conscience if they meete.
 Or lett me Creepe to som%Me dread Coniurer,
 That w%5th%6 fantastique sceams fulfills much paper,
 That hath deuided heauen in tenemts,
 And w%5th%6 whores, theues, & murderers, stufd' his rents
 Soe full, y%5t%6 though he passe them all in sinne
 They leaue himselfe noe roome to enter in,
 And yf when all his arte, & tyme are spente,
 Hee say twill neare be found, oh be Contente,
 Receaue from him the doome vngrudginly,
 Because hee is the mouth >of< desteny.
 Thou sayest alas the gould doth still remayne,
 Though it be Changd' and put into a Chayne,
 Soe in the first fallen Angells, resteth still
 Wisdome & knowledge, but tis turnd to ill,
 As these should doe good workes, & should p%Puide
 Necessities, but now must nurse thy pride.

 Pittie these Angels yet, there dignities
 Passe virtues, powers, & principallities:
 But thou art reasolute, thy will be doone,
 But w%5th%6 such anguish as her onely sonne
 The mother in the hungry graue dooth lay,
 Vnto the fier these martyres I betray:
 Good soules! for, you giue life to eu%5r%6ie thinge,
 Good Angells! for good messages you bringe
 Destind' you might haue beene to such a one,
 As would haue loud', & worshipd' you alone,
 One y%5t%6 would suffer hunger, nakednesse,
 Yea death eare he would make your number lesse,
 But I am guiltye of yo%5r%6 sadd decay,
 May yo%5r%6 few fellowes longer w%5th%6 me stay.
 But oh thou wretched finder, whome I hate
 So much y%5t%6 I almost pittie thy state
 Gould beinge the heauiest mettall amongst all,
 May >%Vmy< most heauie Curse vpon thee fall:
 Here fetred, manacld' & tyd' in Chaynes
 ffirst mayst thou bee, then Chaind' to hellish paynes
 Or be w%5th%6 forran gould bribd to betray [CW:om]
 Thy Cuntry, & fayle both of y%5t%6, & thy pay. [6v]
 May the next thinge thou stoopst to reach, Contayne
 Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst brayne,
 Or libells, or som%Me interdicted thinge
 W%5ch%6 necligently kept thy ruine bringe
 Lust-bredd deseases rott thee, & dwell w%5th%6 thee
 Itchy desire, & noe abylitie.
 May all the ill w%5ch%6 eu%5r%6 gould hath wrought,
 All mischeefes, w%5ch%6 all deuills eu%5r%6 thought,
 Wante after plentie, poore & gouty age,
 The plauges of trauailers, loue, & mariage
 Afflict thee, and at thy liues last moment,
 May thy swolne sinnes themselues to thee p%5r%6sent.
 But I forgiue, repente then honest man,
 Gould is restoratiue, restore it then,
 But yf from it thou beest loth to departe
 Because tis Cordiall would tweare at thy harte.
 I. D.
