Oh shall i2 righteous Angells which as yet

Angells which Heauen com%Maunded to p%Puide
All things for mee, to bee my faythfull guide,
To gaine new frends t'apease new enemyes
To comfort my so>^%5u%6<le, when I lye or rise.
Shall these 12 innocents, by thy seuere
Sentence (great Iudge) my sinns great burden beare.
Shall they bee [rest of l. lost to trimming] [f.31r]
And punisht for offences not their own?
They saue not mee, they doe not ease my paines,
When that in Hell their burnt & tide in chaines.
Were they but crownes of france I cared not,

I think p>%Yr%Zossesseth. they come Heere to us
So pale, so lame, so leane, so ruinous;
And Howsoere french Kings most Christian>%Ys%Z< bee,
Their Crownes are circumcisd most Iewisshly.
Or weare the Spanish Stamps still Trauailing,
That are become as Catholique as theire King
Those vnlikt bear-whelps, vnfild pistoletts
That more then Cannon-shott auayls, or letts,
That negligently left, vnrownded looke
Like many Angld figures, in the Booke
Of some great Conjurer, y%5t%6 would inforce[%1trimmed%2]

Scotland that knew no face drownd in one day

Hauing By subtle fire a so>^%5u%6<le out puld,

But shall my Harmeless Angells p%Pish? sha[%1trimmed%2]
I loose my guard, my life my ease, my all?
Much hope, that they thus nourisht, will bee dead
Much of my able youth & liuely Head
Will vanish; if thou loue %Yth%Z lett them alone

And galle the finders Conscience as they meete.
O lett mee creepe to some dread Conjurer
That with phantastique sceane fills full much paper,
That hath diuided Heauen in Lineaments
That with Whors Theeues, & murtherers stuffs Tents
Soe full, that though Hee passeth all in sinn
Hee leaues himself no rome to enter in:
And if when all this art >%Yit%Z< & Time is spent

Receaue from him the Doome vngrudgingly
Because Hee is the Mouth of Destiny.

The Mother in the Hungry graue doth lay
Vnto the firs these Martyrs I betray
Good soules, for y%5u%6 giue life to euery thing
Good Angells, for good Messages y%5o%6u bring.
Destind you might haue beene, to such an one

One that would suffer Hunger, Nakedness,

But I am guilty of y%5r%6 sad decay
May y%5r%6 few fellowes longer with mee stay.
But o%C thou wretched finder whom I hate
Soe that I allmost pity thy estate,
gold beeing the Heauiest mettall amongst all,
May my most Heauiest Curse vpon thee fall.
Heere fetterd Manicld, & tyde in chaynes
first mayst thou bee: then chaynd in Hellish paines.
Or bee with forraigne gold bribd to betray
Thy country, & faile both of that & pay.
May the next thing thou stoopst to reach con/tayne
Poyson, whose nimble fume rott thy moyst /brayne.
Or libells or some interdicted thing
Which negligently kept, thy ruine bring
Lust bread deceases rott & dwell with thee
Itchy desire, & noe ability.
May all the Euill that gold euer wrought [f.32r]
All mischeifes that all Diuells euer thought:
Want after plenty, poore & gouty age,
The plagues of Trauailors, loue, Marriage
Afflict thee & euen at thy last moment
