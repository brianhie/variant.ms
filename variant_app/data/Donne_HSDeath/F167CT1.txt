Death bee not prowd, though some hath call'd thee
Mighty, & dreadfull, for thou art not soe;
ffor those whom thou thinck'st thou dost ouerthrowe
Dye not poore Death; nor yet canst thou kill mee
ffrom rest, & sleepe w%5ch%6 but thy Pictures bee
Much pleasure then from thee; much more must flowe
And soonest our best men w%5th%6 thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and Soules deliuery
Thou art slaue to ffate, Chance, kings, & desperate men.
And dost w%5th%6 poison, warr, and sicknes dwell
And Poppie, or Charmes, can make vs sleep aswell
And better then thy stroke; why swell'st thou then
One short sleepe past, wee wake eternallie
And Death shalbee no more, Death thou shalt dye!
