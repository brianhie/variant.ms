Deathe be not proude, though some haue called thee
Mighty and dreadfull for thou art not soe
For those whome thou thinckst thou dost ouerthrowe
Dye not (poore Deathe) nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and Sleepe, which but thy Pictures bee
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flowe
And sonest our best men with thee doe goe.
Rest of theire bodyes, and Soules deliuery
Th'art Slaue to Fate, Chance, Kings, and desperat men
And dost with poison, warr, and Sicknes dwell
And poppy, or Charmes can make us sleepe as well
And easier then thy Stroke. why Swelst thou then?
One short sleepe past, we Liue Eternally
And death shalbe no more; Death, thou shalt Dye.
