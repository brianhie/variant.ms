Death bee not proude though some haue called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for thou art not so
ffor those whome thou thinkst thou dost over throw
Dye not (poore death) nor yet canst thou kill mee
ffrom rest, and sleepe (w%5ch%6 but thy pictures bee)
Much pleasure, then, from thee, much more must flowe
And soonest our best men with /thee/ doe goe
Rest of theyr %Jbodye%K[%1var%2:>%5bones%6<] and soules deliuery.
Th'art Slaue to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men
And dost with poyson warre and sicknesse dwell
And poppy, or charmes can make vs sleepe as well
And easyer then thy stroke. Why swellst thou then?
One short sleepe past, wee %J%Yliue%Z%K>%5wake%6< eternally
And Death shall bee no more; Death thou shalt dye.
