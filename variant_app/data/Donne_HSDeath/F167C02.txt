Death be not Prowd, though some haue called Thee
Mightye, & dreadfull, for thou art not soe
For those whome thou thinkst thou dost overthrowe
Dye not, poore Death, nor yett canst thou kill Mee.
From Rest & sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy Pictures bee,
Much pleasure, then from Thee, much more must flow,
And soonest our best Men w%5th%6 the doth goe,
Rest of theyre bones, & Soules Deliverye
Thou art Slave to Fate, Chance, Kings, & desperate men,
And dost with poyson, warr, & sicknes dwell.
And Poppie, or Charmes can make vs sleepe as well
And better then thy Stroake; why swel'st thou then?
One short sleepe past, wee wake eternallye,
And Death shalbe no more, Death thou shalt Dye.|    [CW: (Spitt in.|]
