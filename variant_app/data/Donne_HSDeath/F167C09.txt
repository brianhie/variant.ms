Death, be not proud, though some haue called thee
mighty & dreadfull, for thou art not soe
ffor those whom thou thinkst thou dost ouerthrow
Dye not (poore death) nor yet canst thou kill mee.
ffrom rest & sleepe (which but thy pictures bee)
much pleasure, then, from Thee, must more, must flow.
And soonest o%5r%6 best men with |thee| doe goe
Rest of their bodye, & Soules deliuerye.
Th'art slaue to fate, chance, kings, & desperate men
And dost with poyson warre & sicknes dwell:
And poppy, or charmes, can make vs sleep as well
And easier then thy stroke. Why swellst thou then?
one short sleepe past, wee liue Eternally
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt dye.
