D%+Eath be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for, thou art not so,
For, those, whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which but thy picture be:
Much pleasure then from thee, much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee do goe,
Rest of their bones, and souls delivery
Thou art slave to Fate, chance, Kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poyson, warr[~, (MH)] and sickness dwell,
And poppy, or charms can make us sleep as well,
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more, death thou shalt die. [CW: XI.]
