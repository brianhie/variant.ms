 Kind pittie choakes my spleene braue scorne forbidds
 those teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eielidds
 I must not laugh nor weepe Surs and be wise
 Can Railing then cure these worne Maladies
 Is not our Mistres faire Religion
 As woorthie of all ou%5r%6 soules deuotion
 As vertue was to the first blinded age
 %1Are%2 not heauens ioyes as valiant to asswage
 Lustes as Earths honour was to them Alasse
 As wee doe them in meanes shall they surpasse
 Vs in the end and shall thy fathers spiritt
 Meete blind Philosophers in heauen whose meritt
 Of strickt life may be imputed faith and heere
 Thee whom he taught so easie waies and neere
 To followe damned?  Or if thou darest feare this
 This feare great courage and hie valou%5r%6 is
 Darst thou aid %1Mutinous Dutch%2 & darst thou lay
 Thee in Shipps woodden %1Sepulchres%2 a pray
 To Leaders Rage to stormes to shott to death
 Darst thou diue seas and dungeons of the earth
 Hast thou couragious fire to thawe the Ice
 Of frozen %1North%2 discoueries and thrice
 Colder then %1Salamanders%2 Like deuine
 Children in the Ouen ffires of Spaine and the line
 Whose Countries Limbecks to our bodies bee
 Canst thou for gaine beare?  and must euery hee
 Which cries not goddesse to thy %1Mistris%2 drawe
 Or eat thy poisonous woords courage of strawe
 O desperate coward wilt thou seeme bold and
 To thy foes and his (who made thee stand
 %1Sentinell%2 in his worldes worlds garison thus yeeld
 And for forbidden warres leaue the appointed %1field%2
 Knowe thy foe the fowle diuell is whom thou
 Striuest to please for hate not loue would allowe
 Thee faine his whole %1Realme%2 to be quitt and as
 The worlds all parts wither away and passe
 So the worlds selfe thy other loued foe is
 In her decrepitt wane and thou louing this
 Dost loue a withered and worne strumpett last
 fflesh (it selfes death) and ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 Thou louest and thy faire goodlie soule w%5ch%6 doth
 Giue this flesh power to tast ioy thou dost loth
 Seeke true %1Religion%2; O where %1Mirreus%2
 Thinking her vnhows'd here and fledd from vs
 Seekes her att %1Roome%2, there because she doth know
 That she was there a thowsand yeares agoe
 He loues the Raggs so as wee heere obey
 The %1statecloth%2 where the %1Prince%2 sate yesterday
 %1Grants%2 to braue loue will not be inthralld
 But loues her onlie who att %1Geneua%2 is calld
 %1Religion%2 plaine simple Sollen yonge
 Contemptuous yett vnhandsome as amonge
 %1Lecherous%2 humours there is one that iudges
 No wenches wholsome but course country drudges
 %1Grayus%2 staies still att home here and because
 Some Preachers (vile ambitious Baudes and lawes
 Still new like fashions) biddes him thinke that shee
 Which dwells with vs is onlie perfect, hee
 Embraceth her whom his godfathers will
 Tender to him beeing tender.  as wards still
 Take such wiues as their %1Gardeans%2 offer or
 Pay vallewes.  %1Carelesse Phrigius%2 doth abhorre
 All because all cannot be good as one
 Knowing some women whores dares mary none
 %1Gracchus%2 loues all as one and thinckes that so
 As women doe in diuers countries goe
 In diuers habitts yett are still one kind
 So doth so is %1Religion%2 and this blindnes
 Too much light breedes but vnmooued then
 Of force must one and forcd but one alowe
 And the right, aske thy father which is she
 Lett him aske his though truth and falshood bee
 Neere twinnes yet truth a little elder is
 Be busie to seeke her belieue mee this
 He is not of none nor woorst w%5ch%6 seekes the best
 To adore to skorne an Image or protest
 May all be badd; doubt wiselie in strange way
 To stand inquiring right is not to stray
 To sleepe or runne wrong is:  on a huge hill
 Cragged and steepe truth standes and he that will
 Reach her must about and about goe
 And what the hills soddainnesse resists winne soe
 Yett striue so that before age deaths twilight
 Thy soule rest for none can woorke in that night
 To will implies delay therefore now doe
 Hard deedes the bodies paines hard knowledge too
 The minds endeuoires reach. and misteries
 Are like the sunne dazeling yett plaine to all eies
 Keepe the truth which thou hast found men doe not stand
 In so ill case here that God hath with his hand
 Signed Kinges %1Blanck=charters%2 to kill whom they hate
 Nor are they %1Vicars%2 but %1Hangmen%2 to fate
 ffoole and wretch wilt thou lett thy soule be tied
 To mans lawes by which she shall not be tryed
 Att the last day will itt then boote thee
 To say a %1Phillipp%2 or a %1Gregorie%2
 A %1Harry%2 or %1Martin%2 taught thee this
 Is not this excuse for meere contraries
 Equallie stronger? cannot both sides say so
 That thou maist rightly obey power her bondes know
 Those past her nature and name is changd to bee
 Then humble to her is Idolatry
 As streames are power is those blest flowers that dwell
 Att the rough streames calme head thriue and proove well
 But hauing left their Rootes and themselues giuen
 To the streames tirannous rage alasse are driuen
 Through Mills and Rockes and Woodes and att last almost
 Consumed in goinge in the sea are lost
 So perish soules which more chuse mens vniust
 Powre from god claimed then God himselfe to truste
