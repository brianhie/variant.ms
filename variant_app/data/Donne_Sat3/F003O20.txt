 Kind pitty choakes my Spleene; Braue Skorne forbidds
 These tears to issue, w%5ch%6 swell my Eyelidds.
 I must not Laugh, nor weepe; Sin, and be wise,
 May rayling then Cure these worne Malladies.
 Is not our M%5rs%6 fayre Religion
 As worthy of all our Soules Deuotion,
 As Vertue was to the first blind Age?
 Are not Heau%Y**s%Z%>>Heauens< Ioyes as valyant to asswage
 Lusts, as Earths honors weare to them? Alas
 As wee doe them, in meanes, shall they surpas [f.5]
 Vs in the End? And shall thy fathers Spiritt
 Meete blind Philosophers in Heauen, whose merritt
 Of strict lyfe, may bee imputed fayth, and heare
 Thee whom he taught, wayes easy and neere
 To followe, damnd? Oh, if thou darest feare thys,
 Thys feare, greate Courage, and high Valor is;
 Darst Thou ayd mutinous Dutch? darst thou lay
 thee in Ships, wodden Sepulchers, a Pray
 To Leaders rage, to Stormes, to Shot, to Dea>%V%5r%6<th?
 Darst thou diue Seas, and dangers of the Earth?
 Hast thou Coragious fire to thawe the Ice
 Of frozen Norths discoueries; and thrice
 Colder then Salamanders, like devine
 Children in the Ouen, fyres of Spayne, and the lyne,
 Whose Countryes Limbecks to our Bodyes bee,
 Canst thou for gayne beare? And must euery Hee
 W%5ch%6 cryes not Goddesse to thy M%5rs%6 drawe
 Or eate thy Poysonous wordes? Courage of Strawe,
 Oh desperate Coward, wilt thou seeme bold, and
 To thy foes, and hys who made Thee, to stand
 Souldyer in hys worlds garryson, thus yeilde,
 And for forbidden warrs, leaue th'appointed feild?
 Know thy foes; The foule Devill whom thou
 Striuest to please, for hate, not loue wold allowe,
 Thee, fayne hys whole realme>%Ys%Z< to be ridde, and as
 The worlds all Parts wither away, and pas,
 So the world>'s< Selfe, thy other lou'd foe, ys
 In her decrepitt vayne; and thou loving this
 Dost loue a wither'd and worne Strumpet. Last [f.5v]
 Flesh, (ytselfe Death) and ioyes, w%5ch%6 flesh can last%>>tast<
 Thou lou'st; and thy fayre Goodly Soule, w%5ch%6 doth
 Giue thys flesh power, to taste ioye, thou dost lothe.
 Seeke true Religion; oh where? Mirius
 Thinking her vnhous'd here, and fled from Vs,
 Seekes her at Rome; There, because he doth knowe
 That she was there a thousand a[sic] yeare agoe,
 Hee loues her raggs soe, as wee here obay
 The state Cloth, where the Prince sat yesterday.
 Grant to such braue loues will not be inthralld, 
 But loues her only, who at Geneua is cald
 Religion, Playne, Simple, Sullen, [lc]yong,
 Contemptuous; yet vnhandsome. As among
 Letcherous humors, there ys One, w%5ch%6 Iudges
 No wenches wholesome, but course Country Drudges.
 Grugus stayes still at home here, and because
 Some Preachers, vile ambitious bauds, and lawes
 Still new, like fashions, bid him thincke, that Shee
 W%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs, is only perfect, hee
 Imbraceth her, whom hys Godfathers will
 Tender to him, beeing tender; As Wardes still
 Take such wiues, as theyre Guardians offer, or
 Pay values. Careles Phrigius doth abhorre
 All, because all cannot be good; as One
 Knowing some woemen whores, dares mary[sic] none.
 Grattus loues all as One, and thinckes, soe
 As woemen doe in diuers Countryes goe
 In diuers habitts, yett are still one kinde
 So doth, So is religion, and thys blinde=
 Nes, too much light breedes, but vnmould,[sic] Thou
 Thou#of%>>%YThou%Z#Of< force must One, and forc'd but One allowe; [f.6]
 And the right, aske thy father, w%5ch%6 is Shee;
 Lett him aske hys; Though truth and falshood bee
 Neare twinns, yett Truth a litle Elder is.
 Be busy to seeke her; Beleaue mee thys;
 Hee is not of none, nor worst, w%5ch%6 seekes the best.
 To adore or skorne an Image, or protest
 May all be bad; doubt wisely: In strange way
 To stand inguiring right, is not to stray.
 To Sleepe, or runne wrong, is. On a high hill
 Ragged and steepe truith dwells, and he y%5t%6 will
 Reach yt, about must, and about goe,
 And what the hills sodennes resists, win soe.
 Yett striue soe, that before Age (Deaths Twilight)
 Thy mind rest; for none can worke in the Night.
 To will, implyes delay, therefore now doe.
 Hard deedes the bodyes paynes, hard knowledge too
 The mindes indeauors reach; And Misteryes
 Are as the Sunne, dazeling, yett playne to all Eyes.
 Keepe the Truth that thou hast found, men doe not stand
 In so ill Case here, that God hath w%5th%6 hys hand
 Signd Kings blancke Charters, to kill whom they hate,
 Nor are the[sic] Vicars, but hangmen to Fate.
 Foole and wretch, wilt thou lett thy Soule be tyde
 To Mens lawes, by w%5ch%6 she shall not be tryed?
 At the last day? Oh will it then serue Thee
 To say a Phillip, or a Gregorye
 A Harry, or a Martin taught Thee thys?
 Is not this Excuse for mere Contraryes
 Equally true? Cannot both sides say soe?
 That thou mayst rightly obay Power, her boundes knowe.
 These past, her Nature, and name is changd, to bee [f.6v]
 Then, humble to her, is Idolatree.
 As Streames are, Power ys: Those blest flowres w%5ch%6 dwell
 At the rough streames calme head thriue, and proue well.
 But hauing left theyre rootes, and themselues giuen
 To the Streames Tyrannous rage, Alas, are driuen
 Through Mills, rockes, and woods, and at last almost
 Consumd in Goeing, in the Seas are lost.
 So perish Soules, w%5ch%6 more chuse, mens vniust
 Power; from God clam'd, then God hemselfe to trust.|.
