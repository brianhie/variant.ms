Kinde pitty choakes my spleene, braue scorne forbiddes
Those teares to issue, w%5ch%6 swell my eie liddes
I must not laugh, nor weepe sinnes, and be wise,
Can railing then cure theis wore>>%5n%6<< maladies?
Is not our Mistresse faire Religion
As worthy of all our soules devotion
As vertue was in the first blinded age?
Are not heau'ns ioyes as valiant to asswage
Lusts, as Earth's honour was to them? alasse
As we doe them in meanes, shall they surpasse
vs in the end? and shall thy Fathers Spiritt
Meete blinde Philosophers in heau'n, whose merritt
Of strict life may be imputed faith, & heare thee
Whom he taught soe easie waies, and neere
To follow damn'd? O if thou durst feare this.
This feare, great courage, and high valour is,
Dar'st thou ayde mutinous %1Dutch%2 & dar'st thou >%Ys%Z%5l%6<aye
Thee in shippes, woodden Sepulchers, a preye
To Leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth,
Dar'st thou dive Seas, and dungeons of the earth?
Hast thou couragious fire to thaw the Ice
Of frozen North discoveries, and thrice [CW:Colder]
Colder then Salamanders, like devine [f.3]
Children >%V%5in%6%Yo%Z< th'oven, fires of Spaine, and the lyne,
Whose Countreys Limbecks to our bodies be;
Canst thou for gaine beare, and must euery hee
W%5ch%6 cries not Goddesse to thy M%5rs%6, drawe,
Or eate thy poisonous wordes, courage of Strawe
O desperate coward, wilt thou seeme bould, and
To thy foes, and his (whoe made thee to stand
Sentinell' in his worldes garrison) thus yeild
And for forbidden warres leaue th'appointed field?
Know thy foe, the fowle divell, h%Jis%K[%1Mvar%2:>>he|he's<<], whom thou
Striv'st to please for hate not loue, would allowe
Thee faine his whole Realme to be quitt, and as
The worldes all parts wither away and passe
Soe the worlds selfe, thy other lou'd foe, is
In her decrepid[sp:sic] wayne, and thou louing this
Dost loue a wither'd, and worne Strumpet; Last
Flesh itselfe's death and ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can taste
Thou louest, and thy faire goodlie Soule w%5ch%6 doth
Give this flesh power to tast ioye thou dost loath;
Seeke true religion; oh where? %1Mirreus%2
Thinking her unhousd heere, and fled from vs,
Seekes her at Rome, there because he doth knowe
That she was there a thousand yeeres agoe;
He loues the ragges; soe as we heere obey
The State cloath where the Prince satt yesterdaye;
%1Crants%2 to such braue loue will not be inthralld
But loues her onely, who at Geneva is calld
Religion; plaine, simple, sullen, yonge
Contemptuous, yet vnhandsome; as amonge
Leacherous humors, there is one that iudges
Noe wenches wholesome, but course Country drudges
%1Graius%2 staies still at home heere, and because
Some preachers, vilde ambitious bawdes, & lawes
Still newe like fashions, bids him thinke that shee
w%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs, is onely perfect, he
Embraceth her, whom his Godfathers will
Tender to him, being tender, as Wardes still
Take such wives as their Guardians offer, or
Paye vallewes; Carelesse Phrygius doth abhorre
All, because all cannot be good; as one
Knowing some women whores, dares marry none;
%1Gracchus%2 loues all as one, and thinkes that soe
As women doe in divers Countryes goe
In divers habitts, yet are still one kinde
Soe doth, soe is religion; and this blinde-
nes too much light breedes; but vnmou'd thou
Of force must one; and forc'd but one allowe;
And the right; aske thy Father w%5ch%6 is shee
Let him ask his; though truth, and falshood bee
Neere twinnes; yet truth, a little elder is;
Be busie to seek her, believe me this,
Hee's not of none, nor worst y%5t%6 seekes the best;
To adore, or scorne an Image, or protest
maye all be badd, doubt wisely in strange waye
To stand inquiring right, is not to straye;
To sleepe, or run wrong is, on a huge hill,
Cragged, and steepe truth standes, & he that will
Reach her, about must, and about >>%5must%6<< goe;
And what the hilles suddennes resists; winne soe
Yet striue soe, that before age, deaths twilight
Thy Soule rest; For none can worke in that night,
To will implies delay, therefore nowe doe
Hard deedes, the bodies paines, hard knowledge to>%Y*%Z<
The mindes indeauours reach and misteries
Are like the Sun daz'ling yet plain to all eies
Keepe the truth w%5ch%6 thou hast found; men doe not stand
In soe ill case, that God hath w%5th%6 his hand [CW:Signed]
Signed kinges, blanck%- charters to kill whom they hate [f.4]
Nor are they vicars, but Hangmen to fate;
Foole, and wretch wilt thou let thy sould[sic] be ty'ed
To mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 he shall not be try'ed
At the last daye? >>%V%5or%6<< will it then boote thee
To saie a %1Phillip%2, or a %1Gregorye%2
A %1Harry%2, or a %1Martyn%2 taught thee this?
Is not this excuse for meere contraries
Equally strong? cannot both sides saie soe?
That thou maist rightly obey power; her bounds knowe
Those past, her nature, and name is changd>>,<< to be
Then humble, to her, is Idolatrye
As streames are, power is, those blest fflowers y%5t%6 dwell,
At the rough streames calme head, thrive, & doe well,
But hauing left their rootes, & themselues giuen,
To the streames tyrannous rage, alasse are driven
Through milles, and rockes, & woodes, & at last, allmost
Consum'd in going in the Sea are lost;
Soe perish soules w%5ch%6 more choose mens vniust
Power from god claymd, then God himselfe to trust:
