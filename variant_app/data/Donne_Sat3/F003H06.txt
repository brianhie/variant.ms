 Kind pitty chokes my Spleene, braue scorne forbids
 Those teares to issue w.%5ch%6 swell my eylidds
 I must nor laugh nor weepe sinnes and bee wise
 May rayling, then, cure these worne maladyes.
 Is not our Mistresse fayre Religion
 As worthy of all our soules deuotion
 As vertue was to the first blinded age?
 Ar not heauens ioyes as valiant to asswage
 Lusts, as earths honour was to them? Alas
 As wee doe them in meanes, shall they surpasse
 Vs in the end? And shall thy fathers Spirit
 Meete blind philosophers in heauen, whose merit
 Of strict life may bee imputed fayth, And heare
 Thee whome hee taught wayes >%V%5so%6< easy and neere
 To follow, damnd? Oh if thou dar'st feare this
 This feare greate Courage and high valour is.
 Dar'st thou ayde mutinous Dutch? dars't thou lay
 Thee in shipps, wooden Sepulchers, a pray
 To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dea>r<th?
 Darst thou diue Seas and dungeons of the earth?
 Hast thou couragious fire to thawe the ice
 Of frozen North discoueryes? and, thrice
 Colder then Salamanders, like diuine
 Children in the ouen, fires of Spayne and the Line
 Whose countryes Limbecks to our bodyes bee
 Canst thou for gayne beare? And must every Hee
 Which cryes not Goddesse to thy Mistris, draw
 Or eate thy poysonous words? Courage of straw! [CW:Oh---][miscatch]
 O desperate Cowards! Wilt thou seeme bold, and [p.66]
 To thy foes, and his who made thee to stand
 Souldier in this worlds garrison thus yeeld
 And for forbidd warrs leaue th'appointed field?
 Knowe thy foes; The fowle Diuell, hee whome thou
 Striu'st to please, for hate, not loue, would allow
 Thee fayne his whole Realme to bee ridd, and %Ythen%Z>as<
 The worlds all parts wither away and passe 
 So the worlds selfe (thy other loud foe) is 
 In her decrepit wane, and thou louing this
 Dost loue a witherd and worne strumpet. Last
 Flesh, it selfes death, and ioyes w.%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 Thou lou'st, And thy fayre goodly soule, w.%5ch%6 doth
 Giue this flesh power to tast ioye thou dost lothe.
 Seeke true Religion; Oh where? Mirius
 Thinking her vnhousd heere, and fledd from vs
 Seekes her at Rome, there, because hee doth knowe
 That shee was there a thousand yeeres agoe,
 And loues her raggs so as wee heere obay
 The State-cloth where the Prince sate yesterday.
 Grants to such braue loues will not bee enthralld
 But loues her only who at Geneua's calld
 Religion, playne, simple, solemne, young
 Contemptuous, yet vnhandsome, As among
 Lecherous humours there is one w.%5ch%6 iudges
 No wenches wholsome but course country drudges.
 Grayus stayes still at home heere, and because
 Some preachers, vile ambitious bawds, and lawes
 Still new, like fashions, bidd him thinke that shee
 W.%5ch%6 dwells with vs is onely perfect, hee
 Embraceth her whome his Godfathers will
 Tender to him, beeing tender, as wards still [CW:Take---]
 Take such wiues as theyr Guardians offer, or [p.67]
 Paye valews. Carelesse Phrigius doth abhorre
 All, because all cannot bee good, As one
 Knowing some woemen whores, dares marry none.
 Gracchus loues all as one, and thinkes that so
 As woemen doe in diuers countryes goe
 In diuers habits, yet ar still one kind,
 So doth, so is Religion, and this blind-
 Nesse too much light breeds. But vnmooued thou
 Of force must one, and forc'd, but one allow,
 And the right. Aske thy father w.%5ch%6 is shee,
 Let him aske his. Though truth and falshood bee
 Neere twins: yet Truth a little elder is.
 Bee busy to seeke her. Beleeue mee this
 Hee's not of none, or worst, that seekes the best. 
 To adore, or scorne an Image, or protest;
 May all bee badd. Doubt wisely. In strange wayes%>>way<
 To stand enquiring right is not to stray,
 To sleepe, or runne wrong, is. On a high hill
 Ragged and steepe Truth dwells, And hee that will
 Reache her, about must, and about, >%5must%6< goe,
 And what th'hills suddaynesse resists, winn so.
 Yet striue so, as before Age, deaths Twylight
 Thy mind rest, for none can worke in the night.
 To will implyes delay, Therefore, now, doe
 Hard deedes the bodyes payne, hard knowledge to
 The minds endeuours reach, and misteryes
 Ar as the Sunne, dazeling, yet playne, to all eyes [CW:Keepe--]
 Keepe the#the Truth w.%5ch%6 th'hast found. Men do not stand [p.68]
 In so ill case heere that God hath with's hand
 Sign'd kings blank Charters to kill whome they hate,
 Nor ar they vicars, but Hangmen to fate.
 ffoole, and wretch, wilt thou let thy selfe bee t>%Yr%Z<y'd
 To mans Lawes, by w.%5ch%6 hee shall not bee try'd
 At the last day? Or will it then serue thee
 To say a Philip, or a Gregory,
 A Harry, or a Martin taught thee this?
 Is not this Ex***%>Ex>cuse< for meere contraryes
 Equally strong? Cannot both sides say so?
 That thou mayst rightly obey power, her bounds knowe
 Those past, her Nature and name's changd, To bee                                                           
 Then humble to her, is Idolatry.                                                           
 As streames are, power is. Those blest %Jstreames%K[Mvar:>>[trimmed]wers<<] that \(dwell
 At the rough streames calme head, thriue, and p%Pue well
 But hauing left theyr rootes, and themselues giuen 
 To the streames tyranous rage, alas, are driuen            
 Through Mills, woods, rocks, and at the last, almost    
 Consum'd in going, in the Sea ar lost
 So perish soules, w.%5ch%6 more chuse mans vniust           
 Power, from God claymd, then God himselfe, to trust.
