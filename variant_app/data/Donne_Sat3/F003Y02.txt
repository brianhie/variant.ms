 Kind pitty choakes my spleene, braue scorne forbids
 thes teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eie lids
 I must not laugh & weepe, sin & be wise
 may rayling then cure thes worne maladies
 Is not o%5r%6 mistris faire Religion
 as worthy of all our soules devotion
 as virtue was in y%5e%6 first blind age
 are not heauens ioyes as valient to asswage
 Lusts, As' earths honors were to them, alas
 as we doe them in meanes shall they surpas
 vs in y%5e%6 end, & shall thy fathers spiritt
 meete blind Philosophers in heauen%Ys%Z, whose meritt
 of strickt life, may be imputed faith; & where
 thee whom he taught all ways (easie & neare) [CW:To]
 To follow damn'd[,#under#:] Oh if thou darst feare this [p.18]
 this feare great courage, & highe valour is
 Darst thou ayde mutinous %Ydeath%Z Dutch; darst thou lay
 thee in ship wooden sepulchers; a pray
 to leaders rage, to stormes to shott, to Dea>%5r%6<th
 darst thou diue seas & dangers of y%5e%6 earth
 hast thou couragious fier to thaw y%5e%6 ice
 of frozen Norths discoueries, & thrice
 colder then Sallamanders, like devine
 Children in y%5e%6 Ouen, fires of Spaine & y%5e%6 line
 whose Countries Limbicks to our bodies bee
 canst thou for gaine beare; And for euer he
 w%%ch%6 cries not goddess to thy m%5rs%6 draw
 or eate thy poysonous words; courage of straw
 Oh desperate courage, wild[sic] thou seeme bould, and
 to thy foes, & his, who made thee to stand [CW:Souldier]
 Souldier in this worlds garison; Thus yeelde [p.19]
 and for bi%Yn%Zd warrs, leaue th'appoynted feild?
 Know thy foes, y%5e%6 foule divell whom then thou
 striues to please, for hate not loue would allowe
 thee faine his whole realme to be ridd, & as
 the worlds all parts wither away & pass
 So y%5e%6 worlds selfe thy other lou'd for vs
 in her decrepitt vaine, & thou louing this
 do'st loue a withered & worne strumpet; last
 flesh (it selfe) death, & ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 thou louest & thy faire goodly soule, w%5ch%6 doth
 giue this flesh power to tast ioy thou do'st loath:
 Seeke true Religion; Oh where Morius
 thinking her vnhousd here, & fled from vs. [CW:Seeke]
 Seeke her at Rome, there because he doth know [p.20]
 that shee was there 1000 yeares agoe
 he loues her rags, so as we here obay
 the state Cloath where y%5e%6 Prince satt yesterday
 Morus to much braue loues will not be thrawld
 but loues her only who at Geneva is calld.
 Religion plaine simple, sullen, young
 Contemptious yet vnhandsome: As amonge
 Letcherous humors; There is one y%5t%6 iudges
 no wenches wholesome, but course country drudges
 Grugus stayes still at home here & because
 some preachers vile ambitious, Bawdes & lawes
 still new like fashions, bid him thinke y%5t%6 she
 w%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs is only p%Pfect; he [CW:Imbraceth][miscatch]
 Imbraseth her whom his god=fathers will [p.21]
 tender to him being tender; As wards still
 take such wiues as their Gardians offer, or
 pay values; careless virgins doe abhore
 all because can not be good, As one
 knowing some women whores, dares ma%Yn%Z>%5rr%6<y >%5n%6<one
 Grotus loues all as one, & thinkes as soe
 as women doe in diuers Countrys goe
 in diuers habits, yet are still one kind
 so doth, so is religion, & this blind=
 nes to much light breeds, but vnmoued thou
 of force must one, & forc'd, but one allowe
 And y%5e%6 right aske thy father w%5ch56 is shee
 Lett him aske his: Though true & falsehood be [CW:Nere]
 Nere Twins, yet truth a little elder is [p.22]
 be busy to seeke her, beleiue me this
 he is not of none, nor worst y%5t%6 seekes y%5e%6 best
 To adore, or scorne an Image, or protest
 may all be bad; doubt wisely in strang waye
 to stand inquiring right, is not to stray
 To sleepe or run wrong, is, on an heigh hill
 ragged & steepe; Truth dewells, & he y%5t%6 will
 reach it aboue, must and about must goe
 & what y%5e%6 hills sodennes%Yw%Z reiects, win soe;
 yet striue so y%5t%6 before age (deaths twylight)
 Thy mind rests, for none can worke in night
 To will implies delay; therfore now doe
 hard deedes, y%5e%6 bodies paines, hard knowledg too [CW:The]
 The minds indeauours reach & misteries [p.23]
 are as y%5e%6 sun dazeling, yet paine to all eies
 Keepe y%5e%6 truth y%5t%6 thou hast found, men do not stand
 in so ill case here, but god hath w%5th%6 his hand
 Sing'd[sic] kings blanck Charters, to kill whom they hate
 Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to state
 fo>%5o%6<le, & wretch wilt thou let thy soule be tied
 to mens lawes, by w%5ch%6 she shall not be tried
 At y%5e%6 last day, o%C will itt then serve thee
 To say a Philip or a gregorie
 A Henry or a Martin taught thee this
 Is not this excuse for mere Contraries
 Equally true; can not both sids[sic] say soe
 that thou may'st rightly obay power, her bounds know [CW:Thes][miscatch]
 These past her nature, & name is changd to be [p.24]
 then himselfe to her is idolatrie
 As streames are, power is; Thos blest flowers y%5t%6 dwell
 att y%5e%6 roughe streames calme head thriue & proue well
 But hauing left their roottes, & themselues giuen
 to y%5e%6 streames tyranous rape[sic] (a lasse) are driuen
 Through milles rocks & woods, & at last all most 
 consum'd in going, in y%5e%6 sea are lost
 So perish soules, w%5ch%6 more chuse men vniust
 power from god claym'd, then god himselfe to trust.
