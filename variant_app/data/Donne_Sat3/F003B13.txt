 I must nor laugh, nor weepe sins, & bee wise
 Maye raylinge then cure these worne malladies?
 Is not our Mistres faire religion
 >And%>As< worthy of all our Soules devotion,
 As vertue was to the first blinde Age?
 Are not Heavens Ioyes as valient to aswage
 Lusts, as earthes honor was to them? Alas
 As wee doe them in meanes; shall they surpasse

 Darest thou dyue Seas, and dungeons of the earth? [CW:hast#thou~~~][miscatch]
 Hast thou Coragious fire to thawe the Ice [53]

 O desperate Cowarde; wilt thou seeme bould; and

 And for forbidd warrs leaue the appointed feide?[sic]

 Seeke true Religion. O where Mireus
 thinckinge her vnhou'sd here, & fled from vs
 Seeks her at Rome. There because hee doth know
 That shee was there a iooo yeares agoe,
 Hee loues her raggs; soe as wee here obaye
 the State cloth, where the Prince sate yesterday
 Crants to such braue Loue will not bee enthralld'
 but loues her onely, whoe at Geneue[sic] is calld'
 Religion, plaine, symple, solemne, younge
 Contemptuous, yet vnhansome, as amonge
 Lecherous humoars, there is one w%5ch%6 Iudges
 Noe wenches whollsome, but Course Cuntrie dru>%Vd<ges
 Graius stayes still at home here, & bycause
 Some Preachers vile ambitious bawds, & lawes
 Still new like fashions bid him thincke that shee
 (W%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs is onely perfect) hee
 embraceth her who%M his Godfathers will
 tender to him, beinge tender. As wards still
 take such wiues as their Gardians offer, or
 paye Valewe. Careles Phrigias doth abhorr
 all, bycause all cannot bee good. As one
 knowinge some woemen whores dare marrie none
 Graccus Loues all as one; and thinkes that soe
 As woemen doe in diuers Countries goe
 In divers habitts; yett are still one kinde
 So doth, soe is Religion, and this blinde=
 nes too much light breedes; but vnmoved thou
 of force but one; & forc'd must one allowe.
 And the right. Aske thy father w%5ch%6 is shee
 Let him aske his. Though truth, & fallshoode bee [CW:neere#Twins][miscatch]

 Hee is not of none, nor worst, w%5ch%6 seeks the best.
 To adore, or scorne an Image; or protest
 May albee badd; Doubt wisely. In strange waye
 To stand enquiringe right, is not to staye.
 To sleepe, or runn wronge is. On a high hill
 ragged, & steepe, truth dwells. And hee that will
 reach it, aboute must, & about goe,
 and what the hills sodnynes resists; wynn soe
 Yet striue soe, that before age (deathes twilight)
 thy minde rest; for none can worke in the night.
 To Will Implies delaye, therefore now doe
 harde deedes, the bodies paines. Harde knowledge to
 the Myndes endeavours reach, & Misteries
 are as the sun%M dazelinge; yet plaine to all eyes.
 keepe the trueth w%5ch%6 thou haste found; men doe not stand
 In soe ill case heere; that God hath w%5th%6 his hand
 sing'd kinges blanck Charters to kill whome they hate,
 Nor are they Vicars; but hangmen to fate.
