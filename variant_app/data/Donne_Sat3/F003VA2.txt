 Kinde pitty choakes my spleene, braue scorne forbids
 These teares to issue which swell my eye lidds
 I must not laugh nor weepe sinnes, and be wise:
 May raylinge then cure these worne maladies?
 Is not our maistresse fayre relegion
 As worthy of all our soules deuotion
 As vertue was to the first blinde age?
 Are not heauens ioyes as valliant to asswage
 Lusts, as earths honor was to them? Ah lasse
 As we doe them in meanes shall they surpasse
 Vs in the end? and shall thy fathers speritt
 Meet blinde Philosophers in heauen, whose meritt
 Of strict life may be imputed fayth; and heere
 Thee whom he taught wayes easye and neere
 To follow damnd'? oh if thou darest feare this
 This feare greate courage and high valour is.
 Darst thou ayde mutinouse Dutch? durst%>d>a<rst thou lay
 Thee in shipps, woodden sepulchers, a pray
 To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to [sic]death?
 Darst thou diue seas and dongeons of the earth?
 Hast thou couragiousse fire to thawe the Ice
 Of frozen north discoueries? and thrice.[sic]
 Colder then Salamanders, like diuine
 Children in the ouens fires of Spayne and the line
 Whose courtries[sic] Limbecks to our bodyes be?
 Canst thou for gaine beare? and must not[sic] euery He
 Which cryes not Goddesse, to thy mistresse draw
 Or eate thy poysonouse words? Courage of strawe!
 Oh desperate Cowarde! wilt thou seeme bold, and
 To thy foes and his who made thee ["to"om] stand 
 Soldier in this worlds garrison, thus yeild?
 And for forbid[sic] warres leaue th'appointed feild? 
 Knowe thy foes; the foule deuill, whom thou
 Strius't to please, for hate not loue would allowe
 Thee fayne his whole realme to be rid; and as
 The worlds all parts, whither[sic] a way, and passe:
 So the worlds selfe thy other loud' foe is
 In hir decrepite wane, and thou loueinge this
 Dost loue a witherd and worne Strumpett. Last
 fflesh it selfes death; and ioyes which flesh can tast
 Thou lous't; and thy fayre goodly soule which doth
 Giue thy flesh power to tast ioy, thou dost loath:
 Seeke true Religion; oh where? Mireus
 Thinkinge hir vnhowsd' here, and fled from vs
 Seeks hir at Roome; there because he doth knowe [CW:om
 That she was there a thowsand yeares agoe [f.8v
 He loues hir ragges: so as we here obay
 The state-cloth where the Prince sate yesterday.
 Crants to such braue [om] will not b'enthrald'
 But loues hir only who at Geneua's calld'
 Religion, playne, simple, sullen, yonge,
 Contemptiouse, yet vnhandsome; as amonge
 Lecherouse humors there is one which iudges
 No wenches whole-some but course cuntry drudges.
 Graius stayes, still at home heere and because
 Some preachers, vile ambitiouse Bawdes and lawes
 Still new like fashions, bid him thinke that shee
 Which dwells with vs is only perfect, He
 Embraceth hir, whom his God-fathers will
 Tender to him, beinge tender; As Wards still
 Take such wiues as there Guardians offer, or
 Pay valewes. Carelesse Phrigas doth abhorre
 All, because all cannot be good, as one
 Knoweinge some women whoores dares marry none.
 Graccus loues all as one, and thinks that so
 As women doe in diuers Cuntrys goe
 In diuers habits, yet are still one kinde
 So doth, so is Religion; and this blind=
 nesse too much light breeds: But vnmoud'e thou
 Of forcd[sic] but one, and forcd' must one allowe
 And the right: aske thy father which is shee
 Let him aske his. Though truth and falshood be
 Neere twins, yet truth a little elder is.
 Be busie to seeke hir; beleiue me this
 Hee's not of none, nor worst which seeks y%5e%6 best.
 T'adore or scorne an image, or protest
 May all be bad; doubt wisely: in strange way
 To stand inguiringe[sic] right is not to [sic]stay.
 To sleepe or runne wronge is; on a high hill
 Ragged and steepe truth dwells, and he that will
 Reach it, about must, and about must goe,
 And what the hills suddaynnesse resists winne so.
 Yet striue so, that before age deaths twilight,
 Thy minde rest, for none can worke in that night.
 To will implyes delay: therefore now doe
 Hard deeds, the bodies paynes; hard knowledge too,
 The mind's endeauors reach; and misteries
 Are as the Sunne dazlinge, yet playne to all eyes.
 Keepe the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand
 In so ill case here, y%5t%6 god hath w%5th%6 his hand
 Signd Kings blacke[sic] Charters, to kill whome they hate [CW:om
 Nor are they vicars but hangmen to fate. [f.9
 Foole and wretch wilt thou let thy soule be tyed
 To mens lawes by w%5ch%6 she shall not be tryed
 At the last day? Oh will it then serue thee
 To say a Phillip or a Gregorye
 A Harrie or a Martin taught the this?
 Is not this excuse for meere contraries
 Equally stronge? cannot both sides say soe?
 That thou mayst rightly obay power, her bounds knowe.
 Those past, her nature and name is changd[;%>>:<] To be
 Then humble to hir is Idolatrye.
 As streames hir[sic] power is; those blest flowers w%5ch%6 dwell
 At the rough streames calme head thriue and proue well;
 But haueinge left there rootes, and themselues giuen
 To the streames tyranouse rage, alasse are driuen
 Through Mills and Rockes, and at last almost
 Consumd' in goinge, in the sea are lost.
 So perish soules, w%5ch%6 more choose mens vniust
 Power from god claimd', then god him selfe to trust.
