Kind Pittye choakes my Spleene; Brave scorne forbids
Those teares to Issue which swell my Eyelids,
I must not laugh, nor weepe Sins, and be wise
Can raylinge then Cure these worne Maladyes?
Is not our Mistris Fayre Religion
As worthy of all our soules Devotion
As vertue was in the first blinded Age;
Are not Heavens Ioyes as valiant to asswage 
Lusts, as Eac->>Earths< honour was to them? Alas
As we doe them in meanes, shall they surpas
Vs in the end, and shall thy Fathers Spiritt
Meete blind Philosophers in Heaven, whose Merritt
Of strict lyfe, may be imputed Fayth, and heare
Thee, whome he taught soe easye wayes, and neare
To followe, Damn'd? O yf thou darst, feare thys.
This Feare greate courage and high valour is;
Dar'st thou ayde Mutinous Dutch, and darst thou lay
Thee in Ships, woodden Sepulchers, a Pray
To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to Dearth?
Dar'st thou dive Seas, and Dungeons of the Earth?
Hast thou Couragious Fire to thawe the Ice
Of Frosen North discoveryes? and Thrice
Colder then Salamanders, lyke Devine
Children in th' Oven, Fyres of Spayne, and the lyne
Whose Countryes Lymbecks to our Bodyes bee?
Canst thou for gayne beare? And must every Hee
W%5ch%6 cryes not Goddesse to thy Mistris drawe,
Or eate thy poysonous words, Courage of strawe.
O desperate Coward, wilt thou seeme Bolld, and
To thy Foes and his (who made the to stand
Sentinell in his Worlds Garrisson) thus yeild 
And for forbidden Warrs, leave th' appoynted Feilld [CW:(Know thy,]
Know thy Foe, the foule Devill h'is, whome thou [f.18v]
Strivest to Please, for hate, not love, would allowe
Thee fayne his whole Realme, to be quitt; and as
The worlds all parts wither away and passe
So the worlds Filfe, thy other loved Foe, is
In her decrepitt wayne, and thou loveinge this
Dost->>>Do'st<< loue a wethered and worne Strumpett, last
Flesh (yt selfes Death) and Ioyes w%5ch%6 Flesh can tast,
Thou louest, and thy Fayre goodlye Soule, w%5ch%6 doth
Giue this Flesh power to tast Ioy, thou do'st loth;
Seeke true Religion.  O where, Myrreus
Thinkinge her vnhow'sd here, and fled from vs
Seekes her at Roome, there because he doth knowe
That she was there a Thousand yeares agoe,
He loves the Raggs, so as we here obey
The Statecloth, where the Prince satt yesterday.
Crants to such brave loves will not be inthrall'd
But loves her onelye, who at Geneva is call'd,
Religion, playne, simple, sullen, yonge,
Contemptuous, yett vnhansome. As amonge
Leacherous humors, there is one y%5t%6 Iudges
No wenches wholesome but course Country Drudges:
Graius stayes still at home here, And because
Some Preachers, vile ambitious Bauds, and lawes
Still new like Fashions, bids him thinke y%5t%6 shee
W%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs, is onely perfect, Hee
Imbraceth her, whome his Godfathers will
Tender to him, beinge tender, as Wards still
Take such wives as theyre Guardians offer, or
Pay valewes. Careles Phrigius doth abhor
All, Because all cannot be good, As one
Knoweinge some woemens whores dares Marry None.
Gracchus loues all as one, and thinks that soe
As woemen doe in divers Countryes goe
In divers habitts, yett are still One kinde
Soe doth, so is Religion; And this Blind=
Nes to much light Breedes; But vnmoov'd Thou
Of Force must one, and forc'd but one alowe;
And the right, Aske thy Father w%5ch%6 is Shee,
Lett him aske his; Though Truth, and Falsehoode bee
Neare Twinns, yet Truth a little elder is;
Be Busie to seeke her, Beleeve me this,
He is not of none, nor worst y%5t%6 seekes y%5e%6 Best.
To Adore, or scorne an Image, or Protest, [CW:(May#all.|]
May all be Bad; doubt wiselye, in strange way [f.19]
To stand inquireinge right, is not to straye,
To sleepe or run wronge, is; on a huge hill
Cragg'd, and steepe Truth stands, and he that will
Reach her, about must, and about goe.
And what the hills suddaynes resists, winne soe;
Yett strive soe y%5t%6 before Age, Deaths Twilight
Thy Soule rest, for none can worke in that Night,
To will, implyes delay, Therefore now doe,
Hard deedes, the Bodyes paines; hard knowledge to
The minds indeavers reach, and Misteryes
Are lyke the Sunne, dazelinge, yett plaine to all Eyes;
Keepe y%5e%6 truth w%5ch%6 thou hast found; Men do not stand
In soe ill Case, y%5t%6 God hath with his hand
Signed Kings blanke charters to kill whome they hate,
Nor are they Viccars, but hangmen to Fate.
Foole and wretch, wilt thou Lett thy Soule be tyed
To mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 shee shall not be tryed,
At the last day? Will yt then boote thee
To say a Phillip, or a Gregorye,
A Harry or a Martyn taught thee this?
Is not this excuse for meere contraryes
Equally stronge cannot both sydes say soe?
That thou mayest rightlye obey Power, her bounds Knowe
Those Past, her Nature, and name is chang'd to bee,
Then humble to her is Idolatrye;
As Streames are, Power is, those best flowers y%5t%6 dwell
At the rough streames calme head, thrive, & do well,
But haueing Left theyre rootes, & themselues giuen
To y%5e%6 streames Tyrannous rage, Alas are driven
Through Mills, and Rockes, & woods, & at last, allmost
Consum'd in goeinge in the Sea, are lost.
So perrish Soules, w%5ch%6 more chuse mens vniust
Power from God claym'd then god himselfe to trust.|
