K%+inde Pittie choakes my spleene: Brave skorne forbides
Theis Teares to issue, w%5ch%6 swell my Eie-lidds.
I must not laughe, nor weepe; Sinne, and bee wise
Maie rayling then cure these worne Maladies.
Is not our Mistris faire Religion
As worthie of all our Soules deuotion
As vertue was to the first blind Age?
Are not Heavens ioyes as valiant to asswage
Lustes, as Earthes honours were to them? Alas!
As wee doe them in Meanes shall they surpas
Vs in the End? And shall thy fathers Spiritt
Meete blind Philosophers in Heauen, whose Meritt
Of strict life may bee imputed faith, and heere
Thee, whome hee taught waies easie, and neare
To followe damn'd? Oh, if thou darest feare this,
This feare great Courage, and highe Valour is:
Darest thou aid mutinous Dutche? Darest thou laye
Thee in Shippes, woodden Sepulchers, a Pray
To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth?
Dar'st thou dive Seas, and dangers of the Earth?
Hadst thou couragious fire to thawe the Ice
Of frozen Northes discoueries, and thrice
Colder than Salamanders, like devyne
Children in the Oven, fires of Spaine, and the line
Whose Countries, limbeckes to our bodies bee;
Can'st thou for Gaine beare? And must everie Hee [CW:w%5ch%6]
Which cries not Goddesse to thy Mistris drawe, [f.12v]
Or eate thy poisonous wordes? Courage of Strawe!
Oh desperate Coward, wilt thou seeme bold, and 
To thy foes, and his who made thee to stand
Souldier in his worldes Garrison, thus yeild
And for forbidden warres leave th' appointed feild?
Knowe thy foes; The fowle Deuill whome thou 
Striv'st to please, for hate, not loue would allow
Thee, faine his whole Realme to bee ridd, And as
The wor'lds all partes wither awaie, and pass
Soe the worlds self, thy other lov'd foe, is
In her decrepitt vaine: And thou loving this
Dost loue a withered, and worne Strumpett: last
Fleshe (it self Death) and Ioies, w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
Thou lov'st, And thy faire goodlie Soule, w%5ch%6 doth
Give this fleshe power to tast ioie, thou dost loath.
Seeke true Religion: Oh where? %1Mirius%2
Thinking her vn-hous'd here, and fledd from vs
Seekes her at Rome; There because hee doth knowe
That shee was there a thousand  yeare agoe
Hee loves her Ragges soe, as wee here obaye
The State-Cloath, where the %1Prince%2 sate yesterdaie.
%1Grant%2, to such brave loves will not bee inth'rald
But loves her onelie, who at %1Geneva%2 is cal'd
Religion plaine, simple, sullen, young,
Contemptuous, yet Vnhandsome: As among [CW:Lecherous]
Lecherous humors, there is one, which iudges [f.13]
Noe wenches wholsome, but course Countrie Drudges.
Grugus, staies still at home heere, and because
Some Preachers, vile ambitious Bawdes, and lawes
Still newe, like fashions bidd him thinke, that Shee
Which dwels with vs, is onelie perfect; Hee
Embraceth her, whome his Godfathers will
Tender to him, being tender; As wardes still
Take such Wiues as their Guardians offer; or
Paie values. Careles Phrigius doth abhorr
All, because all cannot bee good: As one
[l.c.]knowing some weomen whores dares marrie none.
%1Grattus%2 loves all as One, and thinkes, soe
As Weomen doe in diuers Countries goe
In diuers habittes, yet are still one kind
Soe doth, soe is Religion, and this blind=
=nes, too much light breedes, but vnmould, Thou
Of force must one, and forc'd but one allow;
And the right, aske thy ffather, which is shee.
Lett him aske his, Thoughe Truth and falshood bee
Neare Twinnes, yet Truth a little elder is.
Bee busie to seeke her. Beleeue mee this
Hee is not of none, nor worst, w%5ch%6 seekes the best.
To adore, or skorne an Image, or protest
Maie all bee badd: doubt wiselie; In strang waie 
To stand inquiring right, is not to st>%Vr<aie
To sleepe, or runne wrong is. One a highe Hill
Ragged, and steepe Truth dwelles, and hee that will [CW:Reache]
Reache it, about must, and about goe [f.13v]
And what the Hilles soddennes resists, winne soe:
Yet strive soe, that before Age (deathes Twilight)
Thy Mind rest; for none can worke in the Night.
To will implies delaie, therefore nowe doe
Hard deedes the bodie[sic] paines; hard knowledg too
The Minds indeuours reach. And Misteries
Are as the Sunne dazeling, yet plaine to all Eies.
Keepe the truth, that thou hast found; Men doe not stand
In soe ill case heere, that God hath with his hand
Sign'd kings blanck Charters to kill whome they hate
Nor are they Viccars but Hangmen to Fate.
ffoole, and wretch, wilt thou lett thy Soule bee ti'de
To Mens Lawes, by w%5ch%6 shee shall not bee tride
At the last daie?  Oh, will it then serve thee
To saie a %1Phillippe%2, or a %1Gregorie%2
A %1Harrie%2, or a %1Martin%2 taught thee this?
Is not this Excuse for meere Contraries
Equallie true? Cannot both sides saie soe?
That thou maiest rightlie obaie Power her bounds knowe.
These past, her Nature, and Name is chang'd to bee
Then humble to her, is Idolatrie.
As Streames are, Power is; Those blest flowers w%5ch%6 dwell
At the roughe streames calme head, thryve, and prove well
But hauing left their rootes, and themselues given 
To the Streames tyrannous rage, alas, are driven
Throughe Milles, Rockes, and Woods and at last almost
Consum'd in going in the Seas are Lost.
So perishe Soules, w%5ch%6 more chuse Mens unjust[yes,"j"]
Power, from God [sic!]damn'd, then God himself to trust. [CW:Well]
