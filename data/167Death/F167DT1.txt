Death bee not proude, though some hath called thee
Mighty and Dreadfull, for thou art not soe
ffor those whom thou thinck'st thou dost overthrowe
Dye not poore Death, nor yet canst thou kill mee
ffrom rest, and sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy pictures bee
Much pleasure then from thee, much more must flowe
And soonest our best men w%5th%6 thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and Soules deliuerie
Thou art slaue to ffate, Chance, Kings, & desperate men.
And dost w%5th%6 poyson, warr, and sicknes dwell
And Poppie or Charmes, can make vs sleepe as well
And better then thy stroak, why swell'st thou then?
One short sleepe past, wee wake ae%Lternallye
And Death shall bee noe more. Death, thou shalt dye.
