Death bee not Proude, though some haue called Thee
Mightye, and dreadfull, for thou art not soe,
For those whom thou thinckst thou dost ouerthrowe
Dye not, Poore Death, nor yett canst Thou kill mee.
From Rest, and Sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy Pictures bee
Much Pleasure, then from Thee much more must flowe,
And soonest our best men, w%5th%6 Thee doe goe;
Rest of theyre bones, and Soules deliuerye
Thou art Slaue to Fate, Chance, Kings, & desperate Men
And dost w%5th%6 Poyson, Warr, and Sicknes dwell
And Poppy, or charmes can make vs sleepe as well.
And better then thy Stroake; Why swellst thou then? [45r; 49r
One short Sleepe past, wee wake eternally,
And Death shalbe no more, Death thou shalt Dye.
