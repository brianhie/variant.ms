Death bee not proud, though som%Te haue,[sic] cald thee
Mighty, and dreadfull, for thou art not so:
For those whome thou thinkst thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee:
From rest, and sleepe which but thy pictures bee
Much pleasure, then from thee, mvch more mvst flow
And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and Soules deliuerie
Thou art slaue to fate, chance, kyngs and desperate men%T
And dost with poyson%T, war, and sickness dwell,
And Poppie, or charmes cann make us sleepe as well
And better then thy stroake, why swelst thou then
One short sleepe past wee wake eternally,
And death shall bee no more, death thou shalt dy[%1missing%2]
