Death, be not prowde, though some haue called thee
mightie, and dreadfull; ffor thou art not soe;
ffor those whom thou thinkst', thou dost ouerthrowe
Die not poore Death; nor yet canst thou kill me,
From rest, and sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy pictures be
Much pleasure then from thee, and(%1var%2:>>%5much%6<<) more must flowe,
And soonest our best men w%5th%6 thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and Soules deliuerie
Thou art Slave to Fate, Chaunce, Kinges, and Desperate men:
And dost w%5th%6 poison, warre, and sicknes dwell,
And Poppie, or Charmes can make vs sleepe as well,
And better then thy stroake; why swellst thou then?
One short sleepe past, we wake eternallie
And Death shall be noe more Death, thou shalt dye.
