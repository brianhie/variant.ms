Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for thou art not soe
ffor those whom thou thinkest thou dost overthrow
Die not, poore death, nor yett canst thou kill me
ffrom rest, and sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy pictures be
Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow,
And soonest our best men w%5th%6 thee do goe;
Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie
Thou art slave to fate, Chance, kings, & desperate men [CW:And]
And dost w%5th%6 poison, warr, and sicknes dwell [59r
And poppy, or charmes can make vs sleepe as well.
And better then thy stroake; why swelst thou then?
One short sleepe past, we wake eternally
And death shalbe noe more, death thou shalt die.
