 Thou louest and thy faire goodly soule, w%5ch%6 doth

 Seeke true religion. O, where? %1Mireus%2
 Thinckinge her vnhousd heer, and fleld[sic] from us
 Seeks her at %1Roome%2. Ther because he doth know
 That she was ther a thousand yeares agoe.
 He loues her raggs, soe as wee he%Ye%Zre obey
 The state cloth where the prince sat yesterday
 %1Crants%2 to such braues loue will not be enthrald
 But loues her only w%5ch%6 at %1Geneua%2 is calld
 Religion, plaine simple, sollemne, younge

 Tender to him beinge tender. As wards still

 Pay valews. Careles %1Phrigius%2, doeth abhorr
 All because all cannot be good. As one

 %1Graccus%2 loues all as one. And thinks that (soe
 As women doe in diuers Countryes goe

 Soe doeth, soe is religion, and this blinde
 nesse, to much light breeds. But vnmoude thou
 Of force but one, and forct must one allowe
 And the right. Aske thy father w%5ch%6 is shee? [CW:om]
 Lett him aske his. Though truth and falshood bee.[sic] [f.6]
 Neere [sic]tynns, yet truth a little elder is.
 Bee busye to seeke her. Beleiue me this.
 Hee is not of none, nor worst that seeks the best
 To adore, or scorne an Image, or p%Ptest
 May all bee badd, doubt wisely, In strange way
 To stand enquiringe right is not to stay
 To sleepe, or runne, wronge is. On a high hill
 Rugged and steepe truth dwells. And hee that will
 Reach it about must, and about goe.
 And what the hills' suddaynes resists, wyne soe,
 Yet striue soe, that before ages twylight
 The mynd rest for none can worke in the light
 To will implyes delaye, therfore now doe
 Hard deeds the bodyes paines. Hard knoledge[sic] to
 The mynds endeauo.%5rs%6 reach, and misteryes
 Ar as the sunne dazelinge, yet plaine to all eyes.
 Keepe the truth, w%5ch%6 thou hast found, men doe not stand
 In soe ill case he%Ya%Zre, that god hat[sic] w%5th%6 his hand

 Nor ar they vica%5rs%6, but hangemen to fate
 Foole, and wretch, wilt thou lett thy soule be tyed
 To mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 she shall not be tryed
 At the Last day. O will it then serue thee?
 To say a %1Phillipe%2, or a %1Gregorye%2,
 A %1Harry%2, or a %1Martin%2, taught thee this?
 Is not this excuse for meere contraryes%Y?%Z
 Equally stronge? Cannot both sides say soe
 That thou mayest rightly obey, %Jpower bownes%K know
 Those past her nature, and nams ch>a<ungd. To bee
