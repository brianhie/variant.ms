 Kinde pitty choakes my spleene, braue scorne forbids
 Those teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eye-lids:
 I must not laugh & weepe sins, & be wise
 May rayling then cure these worne maladies?
 Is not our M.%5ris%6 faire %1Religion%2
 As worthy of all our soules devotion 
 As vertue was to the worlds first blind Age?
 Are not heauens ioyes as valiant to asswage
 Lusts, as earths hono%5r%6 was to them? Alasse
 As wee doe them in meanes, shall they surpasse
 vs in the end? And shall thy fathers spirit
 meete blind %1Philosophers%2 in heauen, (whose meritt
 of strict life may be imputed faith) & heare
 thee whom hee taught wayes easy, & neare
 To follow) damnd. O if thou darst feare this,
 This feare great courage, & high valour is.
 Darst thou ayd mutenous Dutch? darst thou lay
 Thee in Shippes (wooden Sepulchres) a prey
 To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth,
 darst thou diue seas, & dungeons of the earth?
 Hast thou couragious fire to thaw the yce
 of frozen North discoueryes, & thrice
 colder then Salamanders? (like diuine
 Children in the Ouen) fires of Spaine, & y%5e%6 line
 Whose countryes to our bodies limbecks bee
 canst thou for gaine beare? & must euery hee
 w%5ch%6 cryes not %1Goddesse%2 to thy M.%5ris%6 draw
 or eate thy poisonous words? Courage of straw
 O desperate coward will you seeme bold, &
 To thy foes & his who made thee to stand
 Souldier, in this worlds garrison thus yeilde? [f.70v]
 And for forbidden warrs leaue th'appointed feild?
 Know thy foes. The foule deuill whom thou
 Striu'st to please (for hate not loue) would allow
 thee fayne his whole realme to be ridd. And as
 The worlds all parts wither away, & passe,
 So the worlds selfe (thy other lou'd foe) is
 In her decrepit wayne, & thou loueing this
 dost loue a witherd, & worne strumpett: last
 flesh it selfe's death, & ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 Thou lou'st; & thy faire goodly Soule, w%5ch%6 doth
 Giue this flesh power to tast ioy, thou dost loath,
 Seeke true Religion. Oh where? %1Mireus%2
 thinking her vnhous'd here, & fledd from vs
 Seekes her at %1Rome%2, there because he doth know
 That she was there a thousand yeares agoe,
 He loues her raggs; So as we here obay
 the State cloath where the Prince sate yesterday
 %1Crantes%2 to such braue loues will not be inthrald,
 But loues her only who at %1Geneva's%2 calld
 Religion; plaine, simple, solemne, yong,
 Contemptuous, yet vnhandsome; as among
 Lecherous humours there is one who iudges
 Noe wenches wholesome but course country drudges;
003.H08.055om
 Some Preachers (vile ambitious bawdes, & lawes
 Still new like fashions) bidd him thinke that shee
 w%5ch%6 dwells with vs is only perfect, hee
 Embraceth her whom his Godfathers will
 Tender to him being tender. As wards still
 take such wiues as their Guardians offer, or
 Pay values. Careles Phrigius doth abhorre [f.71]
 All, because all cannot be good: As one
 Knowing some weomen whores dares marry none.
 Gracchus loues all as one, & thinkes that soe
 (As weomen doe in diuers Countryes goe
 In diuers habitts, yet are still one kinde:)
 So doth, so is Religion, & this blinde=
 =nesse too much light breeds. But vnmoued thou
 of force but one, & forc'd must one allow,
 And the right. Ask thy father w%5ch%6 is shee, 
 Let him ask his. Though truth & falshood bee
 Neare twinnes, yet truth a little elder is.
 Be busy to seeke her, beleiue mee this 
 Hee's not of none, or worst, that seekes y%5e%6 best:
 To adore, or scorne an image, or protest
 All may be badd, doubt wisely. In strang way
 to stand inquiring right is not to stray,
 To sleepe, or runn wrong, is. On a high hill
 Ragged & steepe truth dwells, & hee that will
 Reach her, about he must, & about goe,
 And what the hills sodainnesse resists, win soe
 Yet striue so that before Age (deathes twilight)
 Thy minde rest; for none can worke in y%5e%6 night.
 To will implyes delay, therefore now doe,
 Hard deeds the body payne. Hard knowledge to
 the mindes endeauours reach; & misteryes
 Are as the Sun, dazling, yet plaine to all eyes.
 Keepe the truth w%5ch%6 thou hast found, men doe not stand
 in so ill case here that god hath with his hand
 Sign'd Kings blanck-Charters to kill who%M they hate,
 Nor are they %1Vicars%2 but hangmen to fate. [f.71v]
 ffoole & wretch! wilt thou let thy soule be tyed
 To mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 we shall not be tryed
 At the last day? Oh will it then serue thee
 To say a %1Philip%2, or a %1Gregory%2,
 A %1Harry%2, or a %1Martin%2 told thee this?
 Is not this excuse for meere contraryes
 Equally strong? cannot both sides say so?
 That thou mayst rightly obey power, her bo>%Vu<ndes know:
 Those past her nature & name's chaung'd: To bee
 then humble to her is %1Idolatrie%2.
 As streames are, power is: those blest flowers w%5ch%6 dwell
 at the rough streames calme head, thriue & proue well,
 but haueing lost their rootes & themselues giuen
 to the streames tyrannous rage (alas) are driuen
 through milles, rocks, & woods, & at last almost
 Consumd in going in the Sea are lost.
 Soe perish soules, w%5ch%6 more choose mens vniust
 Power, from God claym'd, then God himself to trust.
