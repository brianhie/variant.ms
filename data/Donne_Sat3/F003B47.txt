Kinde pitty chokes my spleene, braue scorne forbids
these teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eye lidds
I must not laugh nor weepe, sinn and be wise
may raylinge then cure these worne maladies?
Is not o%5r%6 mistresse fayre Religione
as worthy of all o%5r%6 soules deuotion
as vertue was to the first blinded age?
are not heauens ioyes as valiant to asswage
lust, as earthes hono%5r%6 was to them, alas
as wee doe them in meanes, shall they surpasse 
vs in the end? & shall thy fathers spirite
meete blinde philosophers in heauen whose merritt
of strickt life may be imputed fayth? & here
he whom he taught two easie wayes, and nere
be dam%M'ed? Oh if thou darst feare this
this feare Courrage & high vallour is
darst thou ayde mutinous Datoh?[sic] darst thou lay
thee in shipps (wodden sepulchers) a pray
to leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth?
darst thou diues seas & dangers of the earth?
hast thou Corragious fire to thaw the ice
of frosen north discoueries? & thrice
colder then Salamanders, like deuine
Childrenn in the Ouen, fires Spayne & the Line
(whose Countries Limbeckes to o%5r%6 boddies be)
Canst thou for gayne beare, & must euery hee [CW:om]
(w%5ch%6 cries not goddesse to thy mistresse) draw [99v]
or eate thy poysonous words? (Courage of straw
oh desperate Cowards) will thou seeme bold, and
to thy foes & his that made thee to stand
Souldier in this worlds garrison, thus yeald? 
and for forbidden warrs leaue the appoynted feild?
know thy foe the foule deuill is, whom thou
striu'st to please, for hate not loue would allow
thee fayne his whole Realme to be quitt. & as
the worlds all parts wither away, & passe
soe the worlds selfe (thy other lou'd foe) is
in her decrepitt wane, & thou lovinge this
dost loue a wither'd & a worne strumpett, last
flesh is selfes death, & ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
thou lou'st, & thy fayre goodly soule w%5ch%6 doth
giue this flesh power to tastes ioy, thou do'st lothe
seeke true Religion   oh where's Mireus
thinkinge here, in hausd here and fled from vs
seeks her at Rome, there  because he doth knowe
that she was there a thousand yeares agoe
and loues her raggs, so as we here obay
the stat=cloath where the prince sate ysterday[sic]
Grants to such braue loues will not be inthralld
but loues her only who at Geneua's calld.
Religion, playne simple, solem%Me, younge
Contemptuous yet vnhandsome, as a monge
Lecherous humors, there is on who iudges
no wenches wholesome but course countrie drudges
Grayius stayes still at home here, and because
some preachers, vile ambititious, bawds, & lawes [CW:still#new,]
still new, like fashions, bid him thinke y%5t%6 she [100]
w%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs is only perfect, he
imbrac>%Yh%Z<eth her, whom his godfather will
tender to him beinge tender, as wards still
take such wives as theire Gardians offer, or
pay vallues. Careles Phrigius doth abhorr
all, because all cannot be good, as one,
knowinge some weomen whores, dares marrie none
Gracchus loues all as one, & thinkes that soe
as weomen doe in diuers Countries goe
in diuers habits, yet are still on kinde
so doth, so is Religion, & this blinde=
nes too much light breeds. but vnmoued thou
of force must one, & forc'd but on allow
and the right, aske thy father w%5ch%6 is shee
let him ask his. though trueth & falshoode be
neere twinnes, yet trueth a little elder is
be busie to seek her beleiue me this
hees not of non, nor worst that seeks y%5e%6 best
to adore or scorne an image, or protest,
may all be badd. doubt wisely in straynge way
to stand inquiringe right, is not to stray
to sleepe or runn wronge, is, on a high hill
ragged & steepe, truth dwells, & he that will
reach her, about must & about goe
and, what the hills suddayn%Mes resists, winn soe
yet striues soe y%5t%6 before age, deathes twy=light 
thy minde rest, for non can worke in that night
to will implies delay, therefore now doe,
hard deeds thy boddie payne, hard knowledg too
The  minds endeauou%5r%6s reach, & misteries
are as the sunn, dazelinge, yet playne to all eyes,
keepe the trueth w%5ch%6 thou hast found, men do not stand
in soe ill case here that god hath w%5th%6 his hand
sign'd kings blacke, Charters to kill whom they hate
nor are they Vicars but hangmen to fate
foole & wretche wilt thou let thy soule be tied
to mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 we shall not be tryed
at the last day? or will it then serue thee
to say a Phillipp or a Gregorie
a Harrie or a Martine taught thee this?
Is not this excuse for meere contraries
equally stronge? cannot both sides say soe?
that thou mayst rightly obay power, her bo>%Vu<nds know
those past, her nature & names chayngd, to be
then humble to her is Idollatry
as streames her power is, those blest flowers  w%5ch%6 dwell
at the rough streames Calme head, thriue & proue well
but hauinge left theire roots, & themselues giuen
to the streames tyrannous rage, alas are driuen
through mills, rocks & woods, & at last almost
consumd in goinge, in the sea are lost
soe perish soules w%5ch%6 more chuse, mens vniust
