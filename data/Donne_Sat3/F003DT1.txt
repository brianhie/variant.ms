Kind pittie choakes my splene, braue scorne forbidds
Those teares to issue, w%5ch%6 swell my eye-lidds
I must not laugh, nor weepe sinns, and bee wise
Can railing then cure these worne maladies?
Is not our Mistress faire Religion,
As worthy of all our Soules deuotion
As Virtue was in the first blinded age,
Are not Heaue'ns ioyes as valiant to aswage
Lusts, as Earths honour was to them? alass
As wee doe them in meanes, shall they surpass
vs in the end? and shall thy fathers spirit
Meet blind Philosophers in heauen, whose meritt
Of strict life may bee imputed faith, and heare
Thee whom hee taught soe easie wayes, and neare,
To follow damn'd? o if thou dar'st feare this,
This feare, great courage, and high valour is;
Dar'st thou aide Mut'inous Dutch, & dar'st thou laye
Thee in shipps, wooden sepulchers, a praye
To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth,
Dar'st thou diue seas, and dungeons of the earth
Hast thou couragious fire to thawe the Ice
Of frozen North-discoueries, and thrice [CW:Coulder]
Colder then Salamanders, like divine [f.15]
children in th'oven, fires of Spaine, and the line,
whose countreyes Limbecks to our bodies bee;
Canst thou for gaine beare; & must euerie hee
w%5ch%6 cries not Goddesse to thy mistress, drawe,
or eat thy poysonous words, courage of strawe;
O desperate Coward, wilt thou seeme bold, and 
to thy foes, & his (who made thee to stand 
sentinell in his worlds garrison) thus yeild,
and for forbidden warrs, leaue th'appointed field?
Knowe thy foe, the foule Deuill, his, whom thou
striu'st to please, for hate, not loue, would allowe
thee faine his whole realme to bee quitt; and as
the worlds all parts wither away and passe,
soe the worlds selfe, thy other lou'd foe, is
in her decrepit waine, and thou louing this,
dost loue a withered, & worne strumpett; last
fleash%>fle>>%Ya%Z<<sh it selfe's death) and ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh%>fle>>%Ya%Z<<sh can tast
thou louest, & thy faire goodly soule, w%5ch%6 doth
giue this fleash power to tast ioye, thou dost loath.
Seeke true Religion, oh where? Mirreus
thinking her vnhous'd here, and fled from vs,
seekes her at Rome, there, because hee doth knowe
that shee was there a thousand yeares agoe;
hee loues the raggs, soe as wee here obaye
the state-cloath, where y%5e%6 Prince sate Yesterday.
Crants to such braue loue will not bee inthrald,
but loues her only, who at Geneua is call'd
religion, plaine simple, sullen Yonge,
contemptuous yet vnhandsome; as amonge
Leacherous humors there is one that iudges [CW:Noe]
Noe wenches wholesome, but course countrey drudges; [f.15v]
Graius stayes still at home here, and because
some preachers, vile ambitious bawds, and lawes,
still newe like fashions, bids him thinke that shee
w%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs, is only perfect, hee
embraceth her, whom his godfathers will
tender to him, being tender, as Wards still
take such wiues as their Guardians offer, or
pay valewes; careless Phrygius doth abhorr
all, because all cannot bee good; as one 
knowing some women whores, dares marry none;
Gracchus loues all as one, & thinkes that soe
as women doe in diuers countreyes goe
in diuers habitts, yet are still one kinde,
soe doth, soe is religion; and this blinde=
nes to much light breeds: but vnmou'd thou
of force must one, & forc'd but one allowe;
and the right, aske thy father w%5ch%6 is shee,
Let him ask his; though truth, and falshood bee
neare twins, Yet truth a litle elder is;
bee buisie to seek her, beleiue mee this,
hee's not of none, nor worst, y%5t%6 seekes the best;
To adore, or scorne, an Image, or protest,
may all bee bad; doubt wiselie in strange waye,
to stand inquireing right, is not to straye;
to sleepe, or run wronge is; on a huge hill
cragged, & steepe truth stands, & hee that will
reach hir, about must, and about goe;
and what the hills suddennes resists, winn soe,
Yet striue soe, y%5t%6 before age, deaths twilight,
thy soule rest, for none can work in that night;
to will implyes delaye, therefore nowe doe, [CW:hard][miscatch]
Hard deeds, the bodies paines; hard knowledge to [f.16]
the minds endeauors reach, and misteries
are like the sun, dazeling, yet plaine to all eyes;
keepe the truth w%5ch%6 thou hast found; men do not stand
in soe ill case, y%5t%6 God hath with his hand
signed kings blanck-charters to kill whom they hate,
nor are they Vickars, but hangmen to fate;
foole, & wretch, wilt thou lett thy soule bee tyed
to mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 hee shall not bee tryed
at the last daye? Will it then boote thee
to say a Phillipp, or a Gregorie,
a Harrie, or a Martin taught thee this?
is not this excuse for meere contraries
equallie stronge, cannot both sides say soe?
that thou maist rightly obay power, her bounds knowe;
those past, her nature, & name is chang'd to bee,
then humble to her, is idolatrie;
as streames are, power is, those blest flowers y%5t%6 dwell
at the rough streames calme head, thriue, & doe well;
but hauing left their rootes, & themselues giuen
to the streames tyrannous rage, alass are driuen
through mills, and rocks, & woods, & at last, almost
consum'd in going in the sea are lost;
soe perish soules, w%5ch%6 more choose mens vniust
power from God, claymed, then God himself to trust.|
