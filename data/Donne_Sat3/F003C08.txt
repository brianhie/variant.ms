 Kinde pittie chokes my spleene; braue skorne forbids
 Those teares to yssue, which swell my eyelidds.
 I must not laugh nor weepe sinns, and be wise>>,<<
 Can railing then cure theise worne malladies?
 Is not our Mistris faire religion,
 As worthie of all our soules deuotion?
 As virtue was in the first blinded age,
 Are not heauens ioyes as Valiant to asswage?
 Lusts? as Earths honnor was to them? Alass
 As wee doe them in meanes, shall they surpas
 Vs in the end? And shall thy fathers spiritt
 Meet blinde Philosophers in heauen? whose meritt
 Of strict life maie be imputed faith, and heare
 Thee, whome he taught so easie waies and neare [CW:To.|]
 To followe, damn'd? O%C yf thou darst feare this, [f.7r]
 This feare great courage and high valour is:
 Darst thou aid mutinous dutch, and darst thou lay,
 Thee in shipps woodden sepulchers, a praye
 To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth,
 Darst thou diue Seas, and dungeons of the earth?
 Hast thou couragious fyer to thawe the Ice
 Of frozen North discoueries? And 'th>%^%5r%6<ice
 Colder then Salamanders, like deuine
 Children in th'ouen? fyres of Spaine? and the lyne?
 Whose Countries limbecks to our bodies bee
 Canst thou for gaine beare? And must euerie hee?
 Which cryes not goddess to thy Mistres drawe
 Or late%>>Eate< thy poisenous words, courage of strawe?
 O%C desperate coward, wilt thou seeme bolde, and
 To thy foes and his, (whoe made thee to stand
 Centinell in his worlds garrison) thus yeilde
 And for forbidden warrs leaue th'apointed feilde.
 Knowe thy foe>>,<< the foule deuill h'is whome thou
 Striuest to please for hate, not loue, would allowe>>,<< [CW:Thee.]
 Thee faine, his whole realme, to be quitt; and as [f.7v]
 The worlds all parts wither away and pass>>,<<
 So the worlds self, thy other loued for,%>fo>>e<<, is
 In her decrepitt wayne, and thou louing this
 Do'st loue a witherd and worne strumpett, last
 Flesh (itt selfs death) and ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 Thou louest, and thy faire goodlie soule, w%5ch%6 dooth
 Giue this flesh power to taste ioye, thou dost lothe;
 Seeke true religion; O where, Mirreus,
 Thincking hir vnhou'sd heere, and fled from vs,
 Seekes hir att Rome, there because he dooth knowe,
 That shee was there, a thowsand yeires agoe,
 He loues the raggs, so as wee heere obaye,
 The statecloth, where the Prince satte yesterday.
 Crants to such braue loues, will not be enthralde,
 Butt loues her only, whoe att Geneua is call'd.
 Religion, plaine, simple, sullen, young,
 Contemptuous, yett vnhansome. As amonge
 Leacherous humors, there is one that Iudges,
 No wenches wholesome, butt course countrie drudges: [CW:Graius.|]
 Graius staies still att home here, and because [f.8r]
 Some Prechers, vile ambitious bauds, and lawes,
 Still newe like fashions, bids him thinck thatt shee
 Which dwells with vs, is onlie perfect, hee
 Imbraceth her, whome his Godfathers will
 Tender to him[,%>>>;<<] being tender as wards still[.%>>>,<<]
 Take such wiues as theire Guardians offer, or
 Paie values. Careles Phrigius dooth abhorr
 All, because all cannot bee good, As one
 Knowing some [sic]weomens whores, dares marrie none.
 Gracchus loues all as one, and thincks thatt soe
 As wo[r%>>>e<<]men doe in diuers countries goe.
 In diuers habitts, yett are still one kinde
 So dooth, so is, Religion; and this blind=
 Nes, toe much light breeds: Butt vnmooud thou
 Of force must one, and forc'd butt one allowe;
 And the right, ask thy father w%5ch%6 is shee
 Lett him ask his: Though truth and falshood bee
 Neere twinns, yett truth a little elder is,
 Be busie to seeke her, beleeue me this [CW:He#is.|]
 He is not of none, nor worst, that seekes the best. [f.8v]
 To adoare or skorne an Image, or protest,
 May all be badd; Doubt wiselie, in strange waye
 To stand inquyring right, is not to straye[,%>>>;<<]
 To sleepe, or runn wrong is[,%>>>;<<] on a huge hill
 Cragg'd and steepe truth stands, and hee that will
 Reach her, about must, and about [sic]goe;
 And whatt the hills suddainnes resists>>,<< winne so:
 Yett striue so that before age, deaths twy=light
 Thy soule rest; for none can worke in that night.
 To will implyes delaie, therfore now doe
 Hard deeds, the bodies paines; hard knowledge toe%>>>to%Ye%Z.<<
 The mindes indeauors reach, and misteries
 Are like the Sunne dazeling, yett plaine to all eyes.
 Keepe the truth, which thou hast found. Men doe not stand
 In soe ill case, that god hath with his hand,
 Sign'd Kings blanck charters, to kill whome they hate
 Nor are they Viccars, butt hangmen to fate.
 Foole and wretch, wilt thou lett thy soule be tyed,
 To mans lawes, by w%5ch%6 shee shall not be tryed. [CW:Att.|]
 Att the last day? will itt then boote thee [f.9r]
 To say a Phillip or a Gregorie,
 A Harrie or a Martin taught thee this?
 Is not this excuse, for meere contraries?
 Equallie strong cannot both sydes saie soe,
 That thou maist rightlie obey power, hir bounds knowe,
 Those past, hir nature, and name, is chang'd to bee,
 Then humble to hir is Idolatrie;
 As streames are, power is, those blest flowers that dwell,
 Att the rough streames calme head, thriue and doe well.
 Butt hauing left theire rootes, and themselues giuen
 To the streames tyrannows rage, alas are driuen
 Through mills, and rocks, and woods, and att last all most
 Consum'd in going in the Sea, are lost.
 So perish soules, which more chuse mens vniust,
 Power from god claim'd, then god himself to trust.|
