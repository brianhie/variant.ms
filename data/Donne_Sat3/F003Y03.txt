 Kind pitty choakes my spleene; braue scorne forbidds
 Those teares to issue, w%5ch%6 swell my eye lidds
 I must nott laugh nor weepe sinnes, & bee wise
 can rayleinge then cure these worne malladies
 Is nott o%5r%6 mistresse faire religion
 as worthy of all our soules deuotion
 As virtue was to the first blinded age
 are nott heauens ioyes as valiant to asswage
 Lust, as earthes hono%5r%6 was to them: Alas
 as wee doe them in meanes; shall they surpasse [CW:vs]
 vs in the end, & shall thy fathers spiritt [p.13]
 meete blind Philosophers in heauen whose meritt
 of strickt life may bee imputed faith; & heare
 Thee whome hee taught, soe easie wayes & neare
 To follow damn'd, & if thou dar'st feare this
 this feare greate courage & high valo%5r%6 is
 Darst thou ayde Mutinous Dutch & darst thou lay
 thee in shipps woodden sepulchers a prey
 To leaders rage, to stormes to shott to dearth
 Darst thou diue seas & dungeons of the earth
 Hast thou couragious fire to thawe the yce
 of frozen North discoueries & thrice
 Colder then Salamanders, like deuine
 children in y%5e%6 Ouen, fires of Spayne & the line
 Whose Countries Limebecks to o%5r%6 bodies bee
 canst thou for gaine beare, & must euery Hee
 w%5ch%6 cryes nott goddesse to thy m:%5rs%6 drawe
 or eate thy poysonous words courage of strawe
 Oh dep%Pate[sic] coward wilt thou seeme bold and
 to thy foes & his (whoe made thee to stand
 Centinel in this worlds garrison) thus yeild
 & for forbidden warres leaue the appoineted feild
 know thy foe y%5e%6 foule diuell whome thou
 striuest to please for hate nott loue would allow
 thee faine his whole realme to bee quitt. And as
 the worlds all p%Ptes wither away & passe
 Soe the world ytt selfe, thy other loued foe is
 in her decreapitt wane & thou loueing this
 Dost loue a witherd & worne strumpitt. Last
 flesh (ytt selfes death) & ioyes wch flesh can taste
 Thou louest & thy faire goodly soule w%5ch%6 doth
 Giue this flesh power to taste ioy, thou dost loath
 seeke true Religion, o%C where Merreus
 thinkeinge her vnhoused heere & fledd from vs
 Seekes her att %1Rome%2, there because hee doth know
 that shee was there a thowsand yeares agoe
 Hee loues her rage,[sic] soe as wee heere obay
 the state cloth where y%5e%6 Prince satt yesterday
 Crants to such braue loues will nott bee inthral'd
 butt loues her onely whoe att %1Geneua%2 is cald
 Religion plaine, simple sullen, younge

 Leacherous humo%5r%6s, there is one y%5t%6 iudges

 some p%5r%6cher (vild ambitious baudes & lawes
 Still now like fashions) bidd him thinke y%5t%6 shee
 w%5ch%6 dwells wth vs is onely p%Pfect hee
 Embraceth her whome his godfathers will
 tenders to him, beinge tender, as wards still
 Take such wiues as there Gardians offer, or
 pay valews. Careless %1Pharigius%2 doth abhorr
 All because all cannott bee good, as one
 knoweinge some woemen whores dares marry none
 %1Graccus%2 loues all as one, & thinks that soe
 as woemen doe in diuers countries goe
 In diuers habitts, yett are still one kind

 nesse too much light breeds, butt vnmoued thou
 of force must one, & forc'd butt one allowe
 And the right. Aske thy father w%5ch%6 is shee
 Lett him aske his, though truth & falshood bee
 Neere twins, yett truth a little elder is

 Hee's nott of none, nor worst y%5t%6 seekes y%5e%6 best
 t'adore or scorne an image or p%Ptest
 May all bee badd. doubt wisely in strange way
 to stand enquireinge right, is nott to stay
 To sleepe or runne wronge is one a huge hill
 cragged & steepe truth stands, & hee y%5t%6 will
 Reach her about must, I[sic] & about goe
 & w%5th%6 the suddennesse resist winne soe
 yett striue soe y%5t%6 before age deathes twilight
 thy soule rest, for none can worke in that night
 To will implyes delay, therefore now doe
 hard deeds y%5e%6 body paynes, hard knowledge too
 The minds endeuo%5rs%6 reach & misteries

 Keepe the truth w%5ch%6 thou hast found, men doe nott stand
 in soe yll case heere, y%5t%6 god hath wth his hand
 Signed kings blancke Charters, to kill whome they hate
 nor are they vicars butt hange men to fate
 Foole & wretch wilte thou lett thy soule bee tide

 Att y%5e%6 last day, will ytt then boote thee
 to say a %1Phillip%2 or a %1Grigorie%2
 A %1Harry%2 or a %1Martin%2 taught thee this
 is nott this excuse, for meere contraries [CW:Equally]
 Equally stronge? cannott both sides say soe [p.15]
 That thou mayst rightly obey power her bonds know
 Those past, her nature, her name is chang'd to bee
 then humble to her is Idolatrie
 As streames are power is, those best flowes[sic] y%5t%6 dwell
 att the rough streames calme head thriue & proue well
 Butt haueinge left there rootes & themselues giuen
