 Kind pitty choakes my spleene, braue scorne forbids
 Those teares to issue which swell my eyelids,
 I must nor laugh nor weepe sins, & be wise;
 May rayling then cure these worne maladyes?
 Is not our mistrisse faire Religion
 As worthy of all our soules deuotion
 As Virtue was to the first blinded age?
 Are not heauens ioyes as valiant to asswage
 Lusts, as Earths honour was to them? Alas
 As wee doe them in means, shall they surpasse
 Vs in the End? And shall thy fathers spiritt
 Meet blind Philosophers in heauen, whose meritt
 of strict life may be imputed Faith, And heare
 Thee whom he taught wayes so easy & neere
 To follow, dam'd? oh if thou darst feare this
 This feare great courage & high valour is.
 Dar'st y%5u%6 aide mutinous Dutch? darst thou lay
 Thee in ships, wooden sepulchers, a pray
 To leaders rage, to stormes, to shot, to Death?
 Darst y%5u%6 diue Seas & dungeons of y%5e%6 Earth?
 Hast y%5u%6 couragious fire to thaw the ice
 Of frozen north-discoueries? & thrice
 Colder then Salamanders, like Diuine
 Children in the Ouen, fires of Spaine & y%5e%6 line
 whose contries lymbeckes to our bodyes be
 Canst thou for gaine beare? And must euery Hee
 which cryes not Goddesse to thy mistrisse, draw
 Or eate thy poysonous wordes? Courage of straw! [CW:om]
 O desperate [sic]Cowards! wilt thou seeme bold, and [f.14v]
 To thy foes, & His who made thee to stand
 Souldier in this worlds garrison, thus yeeld
 And for forbidd warres leaue y%5e%6 appointed feild?
 Know thy foes: the foule Deuill, he whom thou
 Striu'st to please, for hate, not loue, would allow
 %JThee%K[M:>|Thee|<] faine his whole Realme to be ridde. And as
 The worlds all partes wither away & passe
 So the worlds selfe (thy other lou'd foe) is
 In her decrepit wane, & thou louing this
 Dost loue a witherd & worne strumpet. Last
 Flesh, it selfes death, & ioyes which flesh can tast
 Thou lou'st, And thy faire goodly Soule, which doth
 Giue this Flesh power to Tast ioy, thou dost lothe.|
 Seeke true Religion. Oh where? Mirius,
 Thinking Her vnhousd heere, & fledd from vs
 Seekes Her at Rome, There, because he doth know
 That she was there a thousand yeares agoe:
 And loues her raggs, so as we heere obay
 The State-cloth where the Prince sate yesterday.|
 Grants, to such braue loues will not be enthral'd
 But loues Her only who at Geneua's cal'd
 Religion, plaine, simple, solemne, yong,
 Contemptuous yet vnhandsome: As among
 Lecherous humours there is one y%5t%6 iudges
 No wenches wholsome but course country drudges.|
 >%Y|Graiyes|%Z<Grayus stayes still at home heere & because
 Some Preachers, vile ambitious bawds, & lawes
 Still new like fashions, bid him thinke that Shee [CW:>>Embra:<<][see#notes]
 which dwells with vs is only perfect, Hee
 Embraceth her whom his Godfathers will
 Tender to him, being tender; As wards still
 Take such wiues as their Guardians offer, or|
 Pay %Yvalues%Z%5>valews<%6. Carelesse Phrigius doth abhorre
 All, because all cannot be good; as one
 Knowing some women whores, dares mary none.
 Gracchus loues all as one, & thinkes, that so
 As women doe in diuers countries goe
 In diuers habitts, yet are still one kind,
 So doth, so is Religion; & this blind-
 Nesse too much light breeds. But vnmooued Thou
 of force must one, & forc'd, but one allow,
 And the right. Aske thy father which is Shee,
 Let him aske his: Though truth & falshood bee
 Neere twins; yet truth a little elder is,
 Be busy to seeke Her. Beleeue me this
 Hee's not of None, nor worst, y%5t%6 seekes y%5e%6 best.
 To adore, or scorne an Image, or protest,
 May all be bad: Doubt wisely; in strange way
 To stand enquiring right, is not to stray;
 To sleepe, or runne wrong, is. On a high hill
 Ragged & steep Truth dwells, And he that will
 Reach Her, about must & about must goe,
 And what th'hills %Jsuddennes%K[Mvar:|suddaynesse|<] resists, winne so.
 Yet striue so, as before Age, deaths Twylight
 Thy mind rest, for none can worke in the night.
 
 

 
 Keepe the truth which th'hast found: men doe not stand [f.15v]
 In so ill case heere that God hath with's hand
 Sign'd kinges blanke charters to kill whom they hate
 Nor are they Vicars, but Hangmen to fate
 Foole, & wretch, wilt thou lett thyselfe be ty'd
 To mans lawes by which thou shalt not be try'd
 At the last day? Or will it then serue thee
 To say a Philip or a Gregory
 A Harry or a Martin taught thee this?
 Is not this Excuse for meere contraries
 Equally strong? Cannot both sides say so?
 That thou mayst rightly obay Power, her bounds know;
 Those past, her nature & name's chang'd, To bee
 Then humble to her is Idolatry.
 As streames are, power is; those %Jb>l<est%K[M:>|blest|] streames y%5t%6 dwell 
 At the rough streames calme head, thriue & proue well,
 But hauing left their rootes, & themselues giuen
 To the streames tyranous rage, alas, are driuen
 Thorough mills, woods, rocks, & at the last, almost
 Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost;
 So perish Soules, which more choose mans vniust 
 Power, from God claym'd, then God himselfe, to trust
