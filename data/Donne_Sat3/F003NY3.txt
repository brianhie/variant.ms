 Kind pity choakes my spleene; braue scorne for%V\%5bids%6
 These teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eylids.
 I must nor Laugh, nor weepe sin, and be wise,
 May rayling then cure these worne maladyes.
 Is not o%5r%6 Mistres fayre Religion
 As worthy of all o%5r%6 Soules deuotion
 As vertu was to the first blind Age?
 Are not heauens ioyes as valiant to assuage
 Lusts, as earths honors was to them? Alas
 As we do them in meanes, shall they surpas
 Vs in the end? And shall thy fathers Spiritt
 Meete blind Philosophers in heauen, whose meritt
 Of strict Life maybe'imputed fayth, and heare
 Thee whome he tought wayes easy and neare
 To follow, damn'd? Oh if thou darest, feare this
 This feare great courage, and high valor is.
 Darest thou ayd mutinous Dutch? darest thou lay
 Thee in Shipps wodden Sepulchers, a pray
 To Leaders rage, to Stormes, to shott, to dearthe,
 Darest thou dive Seas, and dungeons of y%5e%6 earthe?
 Hast thou couragious fyer to thaw y%5e%6 yce
 Of frozen north discoueryes, and thrice
 Colder then Salamanders; Like diuine
 Chilldren in th'ouen, fires of Spayne and y%5e%6 Line,
 Whose Cuntryes Limbecks to o%5r%6 bodyes bee
 Canst thou for gayne beare? and must euery hee
 W%5ch%6 cryes not Goddesse to thy Mistres, draw,
 Or eate thy poysonous words? courage of straw;
 O desperate Coward, wilt thou seeme bold, and
 To thye foes, and his who made thee, to stand
 Soldier in his worlds garrison, thus yeild
 And for forbid warrs, leaue th'appointed field.
 Know thy foes: the foule Deuill, whom thou
 Striu'st to please, for hate not loue would allow
 Thee fayne his whole Realme to be ridd: and as
 The worlds all parts wither away and pas,
 So the worlds selfe thy other loud foe is
 In her de[p%>>c<]repit wayne; and thou louing this
 Dost loue a witherd and worne Strumpet. Last [f.5v]
 Flesh (it selfes death) and ioyes, w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 Thou lou'st, and thy fayre goodly Soule, w%5ch%6 doth
 Giue this flesh power, to tast ioy, thou dost lothe.
 Seeke true Religion; Oh where? Myrius
 Thinking her vnhous'd here, and fled from vs
 Seekes her at Rome; There, because he doth know
 That She was there a thousand yeares ago
 He loues her raggs so, as we here obay
 The State Cloth wher the Prince sate yesterday.
 Crantz to such braue Loues will not be enthralld
 But loues her only, who at Geneua is calld
 Religion. playne, simple, sullen, young,
 Contemptuous, yet vnhandsome; as among
 Lecherous humors, ther is one, w%5ch%6 iudges
 No wenches wholesome, but course cuntry drudges.
 Graius stayes still at home here: and because
 Some Preachers, vile Ambitions bawds, and lawes
 Still, new, like fashions, bidd him thinke, y%5t%6 Shee
 W%5ch%6 dwells w%5t%6 vs, is only perfect, hee
 Imbraceth her, whome his Godfathers will
 Tender to him bein[r%>>g<] tender; as wards still
 Take such wifes as their Guardians %Ywill%Z offer, or
 Pay values. Careles Phrygas doth abhor
 All, because all cannot be good; as one
 Knowing some women whores, dares mary none.
 Graccus loues all as one, and thinkes y%5t%6 so
 As women do in diuers Cuntryes go
 In diuers habitts, yet are still one kind,
 So doth, so is Religion; and this blind=
 nes, too much light breeds. But vnmoued thou
 [LM:>Of force<] Must one, and forc'd but one allow;
 And y%5e%6 right; aske thy father w%5ch%6 is Shee;
 Lett him aske his; Though Truthe & falshood bee
 Neare twins, yet Truth alitle elder is.
 Be busy to seeke her. beleeue me this
 Hee'is not of none, nor worst w%5ch%6 seekes y%5e%6 best.
 To'adore, or scorne an Image, or protest,
 May all be bad; doubt wisely; In strange way [f.6]
 To st%Yr%Zand inquyring right is not to stray.
 To sleepe, or run wrong, is. On a high hill
 Ragged and steepe Truthe dwells; and he y%5t%6 will
 Reach it, about must, and about go
 And what th'hills sodainnes resists, win so.
 Yet striue so, y%5t%6 before Age (Deaths twilight)
 This%>>Thy< Mind rest; for none can worke in y%5t%6 night.
 To will implyes delay: therfore now do.
 Hard deedes y%5e%6 bodyes paynes; hard knowledg too
 The minds endeauors reach; and Misteryes
 Are as y%5e%6 Sun, dazeling, yet playne to'all eyes.
 Keepe y%5e%6 Truthe w%5ch%6 thou hast found: Men do not stand
 In so ill case here, y%5t%6 God hath w%5t%6 his hand
 Signd kings blanc Chartres, to kill whom the>y< hate,
 Nor are they Vicars, but hangmen to fate.
 Foole and wretch wilt thou let thy Soule be ty'de
 To Mens Lawes, by w%5ch%6 She shall not be tryed
 At the last day? Oh will it then serve thee
 To say a Philipp, or a Gregoree,
 A Harry, or a Martin tought me this?
 Is not this excuse for meere contrarys
 Equally strange? cannot both sides say so?
 That thou mayst rightly obay power, her bounds know:
 Those past, her nature, & name is chang'd, to be
 Then, humble to her is Idolatree.
 As Streames are, power is: Those blest flowers which \dwell
 At y%5e%6 rough Streames calme head thrive & proue well:
 But hauing lefte their rootes, and themselues giuen
 To the Streames tyrannous rage, Alas, are driuen
 Through Mills, rocks, and woods, & at last allmost
 Consum'd in going, in y%5e%6 Sea are lost.
 So perish Soules, which more chuse, mens vniust
 Power, from God claym'd, then God himselfe to trust.
