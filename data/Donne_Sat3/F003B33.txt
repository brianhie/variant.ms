 Kind pity choakes my spleene, braue scorne forbids
 These teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eyelids
 I must not laugh, nor weepe sinnes, and be wyse
 May rayling then cure these worne malladyes?
 Is not ower Mistris fayre Religion
 As worthy of all ower sowles deuotion
 As Vertu was to the first blind Age
 Ar not Heauens joyes as valient to assuage
 Lusts, as earths honnor was to them! Alasse
 As we doe them in means, shall they surpasse
 Vs in the end; And shall thy fathers spirit
 Meete blinde Philosophers in Heauen whose merrit
 Of strict Lyfe may be imputed fayth, and heare
 The whome he taught wayes easy; and neere
 To follow dam%Md; O>%Yf%Z< if thow darst feare this
 This feare great courage, and high vallor is.
 Dar'st thow ayde mutinous Dutch, darst thow laye
 The in ships wooden sepulchers a praye
 To Leaders rage, to Stormes, to shott, to dearth
 Dar'st thow diue Seas, and daungers of the Earth
 Hast thow couragious fyer to thaw the Ice
 Of frosen North=discoueryes and thryce
 Colder then Sallamanders, like deuine
 Children in the Ouen, fyers of Spayne and the lyne
 Whose cuntryes Limbecks to ower boddyes bee
 Can'st thow for gayne beare!,[sic] and must euery hee
 Which cryes not, Goddes, to thy Mistris, drawe
 Or eate thy poysonous wordes; Courage of strawe
 Oh Desperate Coward wilt thow seeme bold, and
 To thy foes, and his who made the, %Yto%Z to stand [CW:om]
 Sowldyer in this worlds garrison, thus ye>e<ld [99v]
 And for forbid warres, leaue the'appointed feelde
 Know thy foes; The foule deuell whome thow
 Striues't to please, for hate not love would allowe
 The fayne his whole Relme, to be ridd; and as
 The wolds[sic] all parts wither away and passe
 So the wolds[sic] selfe thy other lou'd foe is
 In her decrepid wayne; and thow louing this
 Doest loue a witherd, and worne strumpet. Last
 flesh (it selfes death) and ioyes w%5ch%6 flesh can tast
 Thow louest; and thy fayre goodly sowle, which doth
 Giue this flesh power to tast ioy, thow dost lothe.
 Seeke trew Religion! Oh whear! Mireus
 Thinking her vnhous'd heere, and fled from vs
 Seekes her at Roome; Ther becaus he doth know
 That she was thear a Thowsand yeare agoe
 He loues her ragges, so as we heere obey
 The state=cloth wher the Prince sat yesterday.
 Crants to sutch braue loues will not bee enthral'd
 but loues her onely who at Geneua is cal'd
 Religion, playne, simple, sullen, yonge
 Contemptous yet vnhan>s%>d<>s<om; as among
 Lecherous humors, there is one w%5ch%6 judges
 Noe wenches holsom but course Cuntry drudges.
 Grayus stays still at home heere and becaus
 Sum Preachers, vyle ambitious Bawdes and %Y****%ZLawes
 Still new like fashons, bid him thinke that she
 Which dwels w%5t%6 vs, is onely perfect, hee
 Embraceth her whome his Godfathers will
 Tender to him beeing tender; as wardes still
 Take sutch wayes as ther Gardens[sic] offer, or
 Paye %Y*****%Z>%5values%6<. Prigas doth abhorr
 All becaus all cannot be good as one
 Knowing sum women whores will marry none.
 Graccus loues all as one, and thinks yt soe
 As women doe in diuers fashons goe
 [LM:]In diuers habits yet ar [RM:]still one kind
 So doth, so is Religion; and this blind=
 nes too mutch light breedes. But vnmooud thou
 Of force must one, and forc't but one allow,
 And the right; Aske thy father w%5ch%6 is she
 Let him aske his: Though trewth and falshood bee
 Neere Twinnes, yet trewth a litell elder is
 Bee busy to seeke her, beleeue me this
 Hee is not of none, nor worst, w%5ch%6 seek's the best
 To adore, or scorne an Image, or protest
 May all be bad, doubt wysely; In strange waye
 To stand enquyering right is not to staye
 To sleepe, or runne wronge is; On a high Hill
 Ruggued[sic] and steepe Trewth dwells; and hee that will
 Reache it abought must, and abought goe
 And what the Hills suddaynes resists, winne soe,
 Yet stryue so that before Age Deaths twy light
 Thy mynd rest, for none can worke in y%5t%6 night
 To will implyes delay: therfore now doe
 Hard deedes the bodyes paynes; hard knowledge too
 The minds endeuors reatch: And Misteryes
 Are as the Sunne; dazeling, yet playne to all eyse
 Keepe ye trewth w%5ch%6 thow hast fownd. Men do not stand
 In so euell case heere, that God hath w%5t%6 his hand
 Signd kinges blank Charts,[sic] To kill whome they hate
 Nor ar thy[sic] viccars, but Hagmen[sic] to fate.
 Foole, and wretch, wilt thow let thy sowle be tyed
 To mens Lawes >by< w%5ch%6 she shall not be tryed
 At the last day; Oh will it then serue thee
 To saye a Pillip,[sic] or a Gregorye 
 A Harry or a Martin taught the this [CW:om]
 Is not this excuse for meere contraryes [100v]
 Equally strong! can not both sydes say soe!
 That thow mayest rightly obey Power, her bounds kowe[sic]
 Those past her Nature, and name is chaungd to bee
 Then humble to her is Idolatrye.
 As streames are, Power is, Those blest flowers w%5ch%6 dwell
 At the rough streames calme head thryue and prooue well
 But hauing left ther rootes and them selues giuen
 To the streames tiranous rage alas are driuen
 Trough[sic] Mills, %Yand%Z#Rocks, and Woods, and at last almost
 Consum'd in going, in the sea ar lost
 Soe perish sowles w%5ch%6 more choose mens unjust
 Power from God claym'd then God him selfe to trust|
