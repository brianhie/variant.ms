Kind pittie choakes my spleen, braue scorne forbids
Theise teares to issue w%5ch%6 swell my eielidds
I must not laugh nor weep sinns, and be wise:
May rayling then cure these worne maladies?
Is not our Maistresse fayre relligion
As worthy of all our souls devotion
As vertue was to the first blind age?
Are not heauens ioyes as valient to asswage
Lusts, as earths hono%5r%6 was to them? Ahlasse
As we doe them in means shall they surpasse
Vs in the end? and shall thy ffathers spiritt
Meet blind Phylosophers in heauen, whose meritt
Of strict lyfe may be imputed ffaithe; and heare
Thee whome he taught wayes easie & neere
To follow damn'd? oh if thou darest, feare this
This feare greate courage & high valo%5r%6 is.
Dar'st thou ayd mutinouse Dutch? Dar'st thou lay
thee in shipps, wooden sepulchres, a pray
To leaders rage, to stormes, to shott to dearth?
Dar'st thou diue seas, & dungeons of the earth?
Hast thou co>%5u%6<ragiouse fire to thaw the Ice
Of frozen North discoueries? and thrice
Colder then %1Salamanders%2, like diuine
Children in th'ouens, fires of Spayne & the line
Whose countries limbecks to our bodies bee?
Canst thou for gayne beare? And must not euery Hee
 W%5ch%6 cryes not, goddesse, to thy mistresse drawe
Or eate thy poysonouse words? Courage of strawe!
Oh desperate coward! wilt thou seem bold, and
To thy foes & his who made thee stand
Soldier in this worlds garrison, thus yeild?
And for forbid warrs leaue th'appointed feild? [CW:Kno%5w%6#thy]
Know thy foes; the foule deuill, whome thou [10
Striu'st to please, for hate not loue would allowe
Thee fayne his whole realme to be rid; And as
The worlds all parts wither away and passe:
So the worlds selfe thy other lou'd foe is
In her decrepite wane, and thou louing this
Dost loue a wither'd & worne strumpett. Last
fflesh itself's death; & ioyes w%5ch%6  flesh can taste
Thou louest; and thy fayre goodly soule w%5ch%6 doeth
Giue thy flesh powre to  taste ioye, thou dost loathe.
Seeke trew Relligion; oh where? %1Mireus%2
Thinking her vnhous'd here, and fled from vs
Seeks her at %1Rome%2; there because he doth kno\w
That she was there a thousand yeers agoe
Hee loues her raggs: So as wee here obay
The state=cloth where the prince sate yesterday.
%1Crants%2 to such braue loues will not b'enthral'd
But loues her only who at %1Geneva%5s%6%2 *cal'd
Relligion, playne, simple, sullen, yonge,
Contemptious; yet vnhandsome; as amonge
Letcherous humors there is one w%5ch%6 iudges 
Noe wenches wholsome but course country drudges.
Graius stayes still at home heer & because
Some preache>%V%5r%6<s, vile ambitiouse bawdes & lawes
Still ne%5w%6 like fashions, bid him thinke y%5t%6 shee
W%5ch%6 dwells w%5th%6 vs is only perfect, Hee
Embraceth her, whome his godffathe%5r%6s will
Tender to him, being tender; As Wards still
Take such wiues as theire guardians offer, or
Pay valewes. Carlesse %1Phrigas%2 doth abhorre [CW:All#because|]
All, because all cannot be good, as one [11
Knowing some women whores dares marry none.
%1Graccus%2 loues all as one, and thinkes y%5t%6 soe
As women doe in diuers countries goe
In diuers habitts, yet are still one kind
So doth, so is Relligion; and this blind=
nesse too much light breeds: But vnmoou'd thou
Of forc'd but one, and forc'd must one allowe.
And the right; aske thy ffather w%5ch%6 is shee
Let him aske his. Though truth and falshood bee
Neer twinns, yet truth a litle elder is.
Be busie to seeke her; beleiue me this
Hee's not of none, nor worst w%5ch%6 seeks the beste:
T'adore or scorne an image or proteste
May all be bad; doubt wislye; in strange way
To stand inquiring right is not to stay.
To sleep or run wronge is; on a high hill
Ragged and steep truth dwells, and he that will
Reache it, aboute must, and aboute must goe,
And what the hills suddaynnesse resists, winn soe.
Yet striue so, that before age deaths twilight,
Thy mynde rest; for none can worke in that nighte.
To will implyes delay: therfore no%5w%6 doe.
Hard deeds, the bodies paynes; hard kno%5w%6ledg too,
The minds endeuors, reach; and misteries
Are as the sunn dazlinge; yet playne to all eies.
Keep the truth w%5ch%6 thou hast found; men doe not stand
In so ill case heer; y%5t%6 god hath w%5th%6 his hand
Sign'd Kings, %Jblack%K[%1Mvar:%2>>blanke<<] charters to kill whome they hate
Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to fate [CW:ffoole#&|]
ffoole & wretch wilt thou lett thy soule be tye'd [12
To mens lawes by w%5ch%6 she shall not be try'd
At the last day? Oh will it then serue thee
To say a %1Phillip%2 or a %1Gregorie%2
A %1Harrie%2 or a %1Martine%2 taught thee this?
Is not this excuse for meer contraries
Equally stronge? cannot both sides say soe?
That thou mayst rightly obay powre, her bounds kno%5w%6.
Those past, her nature & name is chang'd: To bee
Then humble to her is idolatrie.
As streames %Jher%K[%1Mvar:%2>>are<<] powre is; those blest flowers w%5ch%6 dwell
At y%5e%6 rough streames calme head thriue & prooue well;
But hauing left theire rootes, & y%5m%6selus giuen
To y%5e%6 streames tyrannouse rage, alasse are driuen
Through Mills & rocks, & at last almost
Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost.
So perish soules, w%5ch%6 more choose mens vniust
Powre%Y,%Z from god claym'd, y%5n%6 God himselfe to trust
