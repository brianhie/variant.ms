 Is not our Mistres fair religion
 as worthie of all our soules devotion,
 as vertue was >%V%5to%6< the first blinded age?
 Are not %1Heuens%2 ioyes as valiant to asswage
 lustes as earthes honnour was to them? alasse
 as wee doe them in meanes, shall they surpasse
 vs in the end? and shall thy fathers spirett
 meet blind philosophers in heaven, whose merritt
 of strick't life may be imputed faith? and here
 thee whom he taught, soe easie ways and neare
 to follow damn'ed? o if thou darest fear this,
 this feare great courage, and hie valour is;
 Dar'st thou aide Mutinous %1Dutch%2? and darst thou lay

 to Leaders rage, to stormes, to shott, to dearth,
 Dar'st thou dive seas, and dongions of the earth;
 hast thou couragious fier, to thaw the yce
 of frosen north discoveries, and thrise
 coulder then Sallamanders, like Devyne
 children in th'oven, ffires of spayne, and the lyne,
 whose countries, Lymbecks to our bodies bee,
 can'st thou for gayne, beare? and must euery he

 O Desperat Coward, wilt thou seeme bould, and
 to thie foes, and his (who made thee to stand
 sentynell in his worlds garison) thus yeld,
 and for forbidden warrs, leaue th'appointed feyld? 
 Know thie foes%>>foe<; the foule Divell is, whom thou
 strivest to please; for Hate, not loue, w>%Yh%Z<ould alow
 thee fayne his whole Realme to be quitt; and as
 the worlds all partes wither away and passe, 
 so the worlds self, thie other loved foe, is
 in her decrepitt wane; and thou loving this,

 Seeke true %1Religion%2; O.[sic] where? %1Mirreus%2
 thinking her vnhousde heare, and fled from vs,
 seekes her at %1Rome%2; there, because he doth know
 that shee was there a thousand yeares agoe;
 He loues the Raggs soe, as wee here obaye
 the State-cloth, wher the prince satt yesterdaye;
 %1Grants%2 to such braue loues will not be inthrald,
 but loues her only, who at %1Geneua%2 is cald
 %1Religion%2. playne, simple, %1Sollen%2. younge,

 %1Lecherous%2 humors, theris one, that iudges

 %1Grayus%2 stayes still at home heare; and because
 some prechers, >(<vile ambitious Baudes, and lawes,

 w%5ch%6 Dwells w%5th%6 vs is only perfect, he
 embraceth her, whom his godfathers will
 tender to him, being tender; as wardes still
 take such wiues as their %1Gardeans%2 offer, or
 paye valewes: %1Careless Phrigius%2 doth abhorr 
 all, because all cannot be good; as one
 knowing some women whores, Dares Marry none;
 %1Gracchus%2 loues all as one, and thinkes that soe
 as women Do in Diverse Countryes goe
 in Divers habitts, yett are still one kind,
 soe doth, soe is %1Religion%2; and this blind=

 to'adore, or scoorne an Image, or protest,
 may all be badd; doubt wisely: in strang way
 to stand enquiering right, is not to stray;
 to sleepe, or run, wrong is: one a huge hill
 Cragged and steepe, truth standes; and he that will
 reach her, aboute must, and aboute goe,

 yett strive soe, that before age Deathes twilight

 Signed Kings %1Blanck=charters%2, to kill whom they hate,

 %1Foole%2, and %1wretch%2, wilt thou lett thie soule be tyed

 that thou mayst rightly %Yknow%Z#obey powre, her bounds know:
 Those past, her nature, and name is chaungd, to bee

 as streames are, powre is: those blest flowers that dwell
 at the roughe stremes calme head, thrive and proue well;
 but having lefte their rootes, and them selues given
 to the stremes Tiranous rage, alasse are driven
 Through mills, and rockes, and woods, and at last almost
 consum'd in %Ythe#sea%Z#going, in the sea are lost.
