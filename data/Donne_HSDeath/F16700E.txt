D%+Eath be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,
For, those, whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which but thy picture be:
Much pleasure the%M from thee, much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and soules delivery
Thou art slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate \(men,
And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,
And poppy, or charmes can make us sleep as well,
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more, death thou shalt die.
