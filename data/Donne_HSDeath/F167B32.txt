Death be not Proud, though some haue called Thee
Mightye, & dreadfull, for thou art not soe,
For those whom thou thinckst thou dost overthrowe
Dye not, Poore death, nor yett canst thou kill mee.
From %Ysleepe%Z rest, & sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy Pictures bee
Much pleasure, then from thee much most flowe,
And soonest our best men, w%5th%6 Thee doe goe;
Rest of theyre bones, & soules deliuerye,
Thou art slaue to Fate, Chance, Kings, & desperate men,
And dost w%5th%6 Poyson, warr, & sicknes dwell,
And Poppy, or Charmes can make vs sleepe as well,
And better then thy stroake; why swellst thou then?
One short sleepe past, wee wake Eternallye,
And death shall be no more, Death thou shalt Dye.|
