D%+Eath be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,
For, those, whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleepe, which but thy picture be,
Much pleasure, the%T from thee, much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,         [CW: Rest]
Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie           [338
Thou art slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate \(men,
And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,
And poppy, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then,
One short sleep past, wee wake eternally,
And death shall be no more, death thou shalt die.
