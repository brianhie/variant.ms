Death be not proud though wee haue called thee,
Mightie & dreadfull, for thou art not soe:
for those whom thou thinkest thou doest ove>%Vr<thro\w
Dye not (poor death) nor yet canst thou kill mee
from rest & sleep which but thy Pictures bee
Much pleasure then from thee much more must flo\w
And soonest our best men w%5th%6 thee do goe
>>Rest<< >>%Y<<And>>%Z<< of their bodies & Sowles deliuerey
Thou art; slave to fate, channce, kings, & desp%Pate men,
And doest w%5th%6 poison warr & sicknes dwell        [129v
And Poppie or Charmes can make vs slepe as >%Vwell<
And easier then thy stroke, why swelst y%5u%6 then?
One short sleep past we liue eternally,
And Death shalbee no more; Death, y%5u%6 shalt dye
