Death be not proud, thou>gh< some haue called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for thou art not so.
for those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow
Dy not poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee.
Fro%M rest & sleepe w%5ch%6 but thy pictures bee
Much pleasure; then fro%M thee much more must flow,
And soonest o%5r%6 best men w%5t%6 thee do go,
Rest of ther bones, & Soules deliueree.
Thou art Slaue to Fate, Chance, kings, & desperat men,
And dost w%5t%6 poyson, warr, & sicknesse dwell;
And Poppy or Charmes can make vs sleepe as well,
And easier then thy stroke, why swellst thou then?
One short sleepe past, we live eternally
And Death shalbe no more, Death thou shallt dy.
