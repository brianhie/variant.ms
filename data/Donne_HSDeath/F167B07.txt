Death be not proud, though som%Me hath called thee
Mightie, and Dreadfull, for thou art not soe;
ffor those whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrowe
Dye not poore Death; nor yet canst thou kill mee
ffrom rest, and sleepe w.%5ch%6 but thy pictures bee
Much pleasure then from thee; much more must flowe
And soonest our best men doe w%5th%6 thee goe
Rest of thy bones, and Soules deliverie;
Thou art slaue to fate, Chance, kinges and desperate men,
And do'st w%5th%6 poyson, warr, and sicknes dwell
And Poppie, or Charmes, can make vs sleepe aswell
And better then thy stroke; why swell'st thou then
One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally
And death shalbe no more, Death thou shalt dye
