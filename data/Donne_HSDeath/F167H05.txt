Death be not proud, though some haue called thee
mighty and dreadfull, for thou art not soe.
for those whome thou thinkst thou dost ou%5er%6throwe
Dye not (poore Death) nor yet canst thou kill me.
ffrom rest and sleepe, w%5ch%6 but thy pictures be
much pleasure, then fro%M thee much more must flowe
and soonest o%5r%6 best men with thee doe goe.
rest of their bodyes, and Soules deliuery
th' art slaue to fate, Chaunce, Kings, & desp%Pate men,
and dost with poyson, warre, and sicknes dwell
and poppy or charmes can make vs sleepe as well
and easyer then thy stroke: why swell'st thou then.
one short sleepe past, we liue eternally
and Death shalbe no more: Death thou shalt dye.
